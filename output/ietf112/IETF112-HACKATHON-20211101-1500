# hackathon

## Summary

The IETF 112 Hackathon kickoff session provided essential information and guidance for participants. The session highlighted the hackathon's core objective to accelerate IETF standards work by fostering open-source collaboration, improving protocol implementations, and attracting new developers. Detailed instructions were provided on leveraging online collaboration tools (Gather, Meetecho), project organization, utilizing the Hacknet (IETF VPN), and the process for Friday's results presentations, including GitHub repository usage and presentation guidelines.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Hackathon Goal:** To accelerate IETF standards development by integrating open-source practices, improving implementation quality, and attracting a broader developer community to the IETF.
*   **IETF Note Well & Contributions:** All IETF activities are governed by the Note Well. Hackathon code is typically licensed under its own open-source license (e.g., Apache 2.0), distinct from project presentations on Friday, which are considered IETF contributions. Inclusive language is strongly encouraged.
*   **Online Collaboration Environment:**
    *   **Meetecho:** Used for this kickoff and the final results presentation.
    *   **Gather:** The primary virtual space for project teams, offering interactive tables for audio/video conferencing, shared whiteboards, and Hedgedoc-powered notepads. A mini-map aids navigation within the space.
    *   **Team Schedule:** A wiki page where project teams can self-organize and post their meeting times and collaboration methods to accommodate global time zones.
*   **Project Engagement:**
    *   Comprehensive project descriptions and champion contact details are available on the hackathon wiki.
    *   A "Lost and Found" section facilitates matching participants with specific skills to projects in need.
*   **Hacknet (IETF VPN):** An IETF VPN network providing a shared Layer 2 environment for protocol testing. Access requires specific MicroTik devices and adherence to setup instructions.
*   **Results Presentations (Friday, 15:00-17:00 UTC):**
    *   Teams planning to present must sign up on the dedicated results presentation schedule page.
    *   Presentations should be concise (maximum 5 minutes) and focus on accomplishments, technical learnings (especially those relevant to IETF working groups), and any cross-community collaboration.
    *   Presentations are to be uploaded to the `ietf-hackathon/ietf112-project-presentations` GitHub repository.
    *   Presenters must be members of the IETF GitHub organization, have two-factor authentication (2FA) enabled, and ensure their real name is associated with their GitHub account for repository write access.
    *   Optional PowerPoint and HTML templates are available to assist with presentation preparation.
    *   Teams will present their own slides live via audio/video sharing.
*   **IETF Hackathon GitHub Organization:** Serves as a central location for project code repositories and the designated repository for results presentations.
*   **Sponsorship:** CNEC was acknowledged as the running code sponsor for IETF 112.
*   **Support:** Hackathon chairs (Charles and Barry) are available for assistance via `hackathon-chairs@ietf.org` and within the Gather space.
*   **Suggestion:** Investigate the feasibility of providing an ICS feed for the team schedule page to improve calendar integration.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Policy Clarification:** Code developed during the hackathon is typically governed by its own open-source license, whereas project presentations shared at the closing session are considered IETF contributions.
*   **Action Item (Project Champions):**
    *   Post your project's planned meeting times and collaboration methods on the wiki's team schedule page.
    *   Sign up your project for a presentation slot on the results presentation schedule page for Friday's session.
    *   Prepare and upload your project presentation to the `ietf-hackathon/ietf112-project-presentations` GitHub repository before Friday.
*   **Action Item (All Presenters):**
    *   Ensure you are a member of the IETF GitHub organization, have 2FA enabled, and your real name is associated with your GitHub account to enable presentation uploads.

## Next Steps

*   **Throughout the Week:** Project teams are to commence collaboration and self-organize meetings using Gather, Hacknet, and other preferred tools.
*   **Ongoing:** All participants are encouraged to engage with project champions, explore the features of the Gather space (e.g., whiteboards, notepads), and utilize Hacknet for shared network testing if required.
*   **Prior to Friday's Session:** All projects intending to present must have registered for a time slot and uploaded their presentation materials to the designated GitHub repository.
*   **Friday, 15:00-17:00 UTC:** Attend the Hackathon Results Presentation session to share project outcomes and learn from other teams.
