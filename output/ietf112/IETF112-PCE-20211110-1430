# pce

## Summary

The pce working group session covered updates on existing documents, including those in the RFC editor queue, those awaiting AD review, and several nearing Working Group Last Call (WGLC) or requiring further chairs' decisions. Several new or significantly updated drafts were presented, requesting feedback and working group adoption. Key discussions revolved around PCEP extensions for multi-path signaling, support for SR policy candidate paths, path MTU, in-situ OAM (IFIT), and ingress protection. Authors were encouraged to engage the mailing list for significant changes and clarify relationships between overlapping drafts.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Administrative Updates**
    *   Reminders on IPR rules, conduct guidelines, and online meeting etiquette were provided.
    *   Harry is acting as secretary, using notes.ietf.org / CodeMD for minutes.
    *   Emphasis on using the mailing list for discussions, polls, and creating new threads.
    *   Reminder about the wiki for relevant information and the process for early IANA code point allocation.
    *   The agenda for both PCE sessions was presented without objections.

*   **Document Status Updates**
    *   **No new RFCs** since the last IETF.
    *   **L2 VPN Flow Spec (RFC editor queue):** A blocking part (L2 VPN flow spec) was stripped into a separate ID. Authors asked for quick adoption of the new ID given prior consensus. This question remains open.
    *   **Binding SID:** Updated to address AD comments; awaiting AD review.
    *   **Errata (RBNF Ordering):** Rejected with reasoning provided on the mailing list. A new ID for this issue is proposed for discussion in the Friday session.
    *   **Early IANA Code Points:** Three documents received early allocation; expiry dates noted, requiring extensions if publication is delayed.
    *   **Stateful GMPLS:** Authors confirmed it is ready for Working Group Last Call (WGLC).
    *   **Enhanced ERR:** Low interest in previous polls. Chairs are considering marking it experimental or "waiting for implementation" in the data tracker, or publishing alongside related work. A decision will be made after IETF 112.
    *   **PCEP YANG:** Updated, needs Yang Doctor review and WGLC. Dependencies (i.e., `ietf-tls-client`, `ietf-tls-server`, `ietf-te-yang`) are nearing WGLC, clearing the path.
    *   **Native IP:** Feedback is being sought from the IDR WG, with an agenda slot in their upcoming session. Cross-posting for WGLC in both WGs is planned.
    *   **Flex-Grid:** No recent changes; authors to confirm readiness.
    *   **SRv6:** Stable, nearing WGLC.
    *   **VN Association:** Authors confirmed it is ready for WGLC.
    *   **SR Path Segment & SR Bi-directional:** Updated with mainly editorial changes to sync with published documents, no open issues, nearing WGLC.
    *   **Local Protection Enforcement:** Updated, has IANA allocation, two implementations; authors encouraged to prepare for WGLC.
    *   **PCC SR:** Updated to align with RFC 1950.
    *   **Stateful Inter-Domain:** No update this time.
    *   **Extended Flags:** New version posted, comments from adoption call handled.
    *   **Multipath:** Updated, comments from adoption call handled.
    *   **Optional Objects:** Updated, comments from adoption call handled.
    *   **Adoption Poll Queue:** An ongoing poll for `sr-pcep-to-mp-policy`. A reshuffling of the adoption queue is planned after IETF 112 based on feedback.

*   **PCEP Extensions for Signaling Multi-Path Information (draft-ietf-pce-pcep-multipath-07)**
    *   Presented by Mike (Cisco). Allows the PCE to return multiple forward and reverse paths for a computation request, independent of the data plane (e.g., SR policy, RSVP-TE). Applicable to stateful and stateless PCEP.
    *   Introduced an `Opposite Direction Path TLV` within the `Path Attributes Object` to specify reverse paths. This relationship is not necessarily mutual.
    *   Demonstrated with an example of circuit-style SR policies, where each policy head-end needs to know both forward and corresponding reverse paths.
    *   Discussion with Cheng (Huawei) about the relationship with `sr-bi-directional` draft. The presenter clarified this draft supports multiple segment lists within a candidate path, complementing the candidate path association in `sr-bi-directional`.
    *   Chairs requested authors to discuss significant changes on the mailing list for wider WG feedback and to add text clarifying the relationship/differences with `sr-bi-directional`.
    *   Authors noted no current implementation status, requested IANA code points.
    *   Boris (Huawei) requested implementation status to be added to the next version.
    *   Rakesh (Cisco) stated `sr-bi-directional` draft includes text on its relationship with this draft.
    *   The AD (John) mentioned concerns raised in Spring WG regarding backup segment lists in SR policy architecture.
    *   Lou (Juniper) suggested an opportunity to merge the multi-path and `sr-bi-directional` drafts, or at least add text linking them. Authors maintain they address different use cases.

*   **PCEP Extensions to Support Segment Routing Policy Candidate Paths (draft-ietf-pce-sr-policy-candidate-paths-05)**
    *   Presented by Mike (Cisco). Proposes PCEP extensions to support generic tunnel mechanisms from the SR policy architecture draft, applicable to SR-TE, RSVP-TE, and future tunnels.
    *   Introduced `Invalidation TLV` to specify actions (redirect to IGP or drop) if a path becomes invalid.
    *   Proposed a bit in the `Path Binding TLV` to indicate if a B-SID is mandatory for programming if the PCE is unavailable.
    *   Suggested making the `SR Policy Candidate Path ID TLV` optional in PC Initiate messages.
    *   Reported Cisco and Juniper have production implementations (via vendor TLVs) and successful interop testing.
    *   Boris (Huawei) requested clarification on `PCE Initiate` message content and acknowledged the production status.
    *   Chairs questioned the inclusion of generic mechanisms in an SR-specific document, suggesting authors clarify that while rooted in SR policy, the encodings are generic, or add a paragraph stating their broader applicability.
    *   Authors requested IANA code points for new TLVs.

*   **Support of Path MTU in PCEP Protocol (draft-ietf-pce-pcep-path-mtu-05)**
    *   Presented by Lou (MTN). Motivates the need for path MTU signaling in SR tunnels to avoid packet drops due to fragmentation.
    *   Updates addressed terminology clarification, path adjustment for protection (TI-LFA), relationship with maximum SID depth, and multi-path support.
    *   Requested working group adoption.

*   **PCEP Extensions to Enable In-Situ OAM (IFIT) (draft-ietf-pce-pcep-ifit-03)**
    *   Presented by Giuseppe (Ericsson). Defines PCEP extensions to signal IFIT (In-situ OAM, on-path telemetry, alternate marking) capabilities and attributes.
    *   Latest changes focused on application in controlled domains for security reasons.
    *   Defines `IFIT Capability TLV` (in Open Object, with flags for IOM types and alternate marking) and `IFIT Status TLV` (in LSPA Object, for configurable features).
    *   Noted IFIT methods are maturing for SR-MPLS.
    *   Requested working group adoption. Authors will consider registry for flags.

*   **PCEP for Ingress Protection (draft-ietf-pce-ingress-protection-00)**
    *   Presented by Hwu-mei (Huawei). This is a merged draft providing ingress protection for SR and B-RTE paths, offering a foundation for protecting different path types.
    *   Updated `Ingress Protection Capability Sub-TLV` and `Ingress Protection Sub-TLV` to include path type indicators (SR, B-RTE flags).
    *   Chairs questioned the necessity of differentiating so much by path type when the PCEP procedures might be generic, suggesting it could be a common generic draft.
    *   Jeffrey (ZTE) asked if it was discussed in Spring or BIER WGs; it has not yet been, but it was suggested it should be.
    *   Mike (Cisco) asked for clarification on communication with CE devices (acknowledged by author) and applicable overlay types (e.g., L3VPN).
    *   Chairs requested authors to address past comments and the generic vs. path-specific differentiation.
    *   Requested working group adoption.

## Decisions and Action Items
