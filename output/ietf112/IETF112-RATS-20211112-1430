## Summary

The `rats` session covered critical discussions on the relationships and potential overlaps between existing drafts: EAT, Attestation Results, and Attestation Sets. The working group also discussed the adoption of the Direct Anonymous Attestation (DAA) draft and received a presentation on the Concise Reference Integrity Manifest (CoRIM). Key decisions included proceeding with Working Group Last Call for the EAT draft, adopting the DAA draft, and initiating a mailing list discussion for the IPR status of the Architecture draft before submitting it to IESG.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Overlap between EAT, Attestation Results, and Attestation Sets**
    *   Authors of `draft-ietf-rats-eat`, `draft-ietf-rats-attestation-results`, and `draft-ietf-rats-attestation-sets` (Moriarty draft) discussed overlaps.
    *   **EAT & Attestation Sets**: Consensus that EAT defines claims, and Attestation Sets can reuse these definitions. Attestation Sets might define new claims that could be added to EAT over time. The primary distinction is that Attestation Sets defines what a "set" of attestations looks like, which is not covered by EAT.
    *   **Attestation Sets & Attestation Results**: No obvious overlap was identified. Attestation Sets define types and sets of evidence, while Attestation Results deals with trustworthiness claims generated by a verifier.
    *   **EAT & Attestation Results**: There are identity claims in EAT and categories of identity types in Attestation Results. It was noted that new claims from Attestation Results could be incorporated into EAT, and EAT's identity types could be used in embodiments of Attestation Results.
    *   **Overall Overlap Assessment**: No major normative conflicts were identified between the existing drafts.
    *   **"Software Result" Claim**: A question was raised regarding a pull request for "software result" in EAT and its relation to Attestation Results. It was clarified that Attestation Results evaluates the overall trustworthiness of a device, distinct from supplementary verifier approval of specific claims, indicating no conflict.
    *   **Documenting Relationships**: The need for a working group document to permanently record the relationships and justifications between these drafts (schema dependencies, information models) was discussed, recognizing it as a "very hard problem."
    *   **Nature of Attestation Results**: Lawrence challenged the idea of a single "Attestation Results" draft, proposing that there are many forms (simple boolean, vectors, large claim sets, certification info, etc.). He suggested Eric's draft could be implemented using EAT, Yang, SNMP, or XML, and requested it not be named to imply it's the sole solution.

*   **Direct Anonymous Attestation (DAA) Draft Adoption (`draft-ietf-rats-daa`)**
    *   A call for adoption was discussed, following earlier mailing list comments and a formal adoption poll initiated during the session.
    *   **Need for further work**: Lawrence noted that more work is needed to support the broad class of DAA algorithms, specifically Intel's EPID. Hank agreed this should be addressed as a working group item.
    *   **Conflict with TCG**: Gary asked about potential conflicts with TCG definitions. Hank explained that this draft's purpose is to map DAA to the RATS architecture, defining roles and extending messages, which isn't covered by TCG alone. It also aims to support non-TCG use cases.
    *   **Mailing List vs. Live Poll**: Roman observed that the mailing list call for adoption had limited non-author support, but the live poll showed stronger support (15 in favor). No objections were raised during the meeting.
    *   **Volunteer Interest**: A poll indicated a fair number of attendees were willing to work on the DAA draft.

*   **Concise Reference Integrity Manifest (CoRIM) Presentation (`draft-ietf-rats-corim`)**
    *   Hank presented the CoRIM draft, aimed at informing and verifying attester characteristics.
    *   **Content**: Includes initial reference values, verification key material, and endorsed values (e.g., FIPS compliance, isolation qualities).
    *   **Extensibility**: Key for adding new claims and future EAT claims.
    *   **Applicability**: Adopted by TCG (information model), supports layered attestation, and has a profile being created for ARM PSA token ID/endorsements. Running code and proof-of-concept implementations exist (e.g., Open-source RATS components).
    *   **Components**: CoRIM acts as an umbrella manifest. CoMID (Concise Module Identifier) covers hardware hierarchy and firmware. CoSWID (Concise Software ID) covers file systems.
    *   **Charter Fit**: Authors believe CoRIM aligns well with the RATS charter, addressing deliverables 2, 3, and 4, by standardizing formats for assertions about system components, associating with evidence, and being consumed by verifiers. Supply chain stakeholders are involved.
    *   **Readiness**: The document is considered stable by multiple vendors and is in public review (expected next week). The authors are comfortable with a call for adoption.

*   **EAT Draft Readiness for Working Group Last Call (WGLC)**
    *   **Teep Requirements**: Discussion focused on Teep's request for a "class identifier" claim. Teep recommended that EAT define the claim, but profiles and vendors define its values and semantics. The values should be opaque/unstructured.
    *   **Consensus on Class Claim**: Lawrence noted ongoing discussion on GitHub (Thomas, Jeremy) and felt there wasn't full consensus on this specific claim yet.
    *   **Other WGLC Issues**: Lawrence also highlighted other potential WGLC issues, such as CDDL for GWT/CWT and JSON/CBOR support.
    *   **WGLC Poll**: A poll was conducted to assess if `draft-ietf-rats-eat-11` was ready for Working Group Last Call. The poll showed consensus for a *first* WGLC, with the understanding that further issues might lead to a second WGLC.

*   **Architecture Draft Status (`draft-ietf-rats-architecture`)**
    *   The Architecture draft had completed working group technical reviews, including multiple WGLCs.
    *   **IPR Issues**: During the shepherding process, two IPR claims were posted. Chairs initiated a mailing list discussion to gather working group consensus on proceeding despite the IPR claims.
    *   **Next Steps**: Roman clarified that the technical work is complete, and the remaining hurdle is to confirm working group harmony regarding the IPR disclosures before advancing to IESG for publication. A 2-week call on the mailing list for IPR feedback is planned.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **DAA Draft Adoption**: The working group decided to **adopt** `draft-ietf-rats-daa` as a working group document.
    *   **Action**: Authors (Hank et al.) to convert the draft to an IETF format.
    *   **Action**: Volunteers who expressed interest are encouraged to collaborate with the authors to improve the draft.
*   **EAT Draft Working Group Last Call**: The working group reached **consensus to proceed with a first Working Group Last Call** for `draft-ietf-rats-eat-11`.
    *   **Action**: Chairs to initiate the first WGLC for `draft-ietf-rats-eat-11`.
    *   **Action**: Discussion regarding the "class identifier" claim and other minor issues (CDDL, JSON/CBOR) should continue on the mailing list, potentially leading to a subsequent WGLC if significant changes are needed.
*   **Architecture Draft Publication**: The working group will conduct a **2-week call for feedback on IPR statements** on the mailing list to confirm consensus for submitting `draft-ietf-rats-architecture` to the IESG for publication.
    *   **Action**: Chairs (Nancy, Kathleen) and Shepherd (Roman) to initiate and manage the IPR feedback call.
*   **CoRIM Draft Adoption**: The chairs will initiate a **call for adoption** for `draft-ietf-rats-corim` on the mailing list.
    *   **Action**: Chairs to initiate the call for adoption on the mailing list.

## Next Steps

*   The chairs will initiate the Working Group Last Call for the EAT draft.
*   The chairs will initiate a 2-week mailing list call for IPR feedback on the Architecture draft.
*   The chairs will initiate a call for adoption for the CoRIM draft on the mailing list.
*   DAA draft authors will prepare the IETF draft version and engage with volunteers.
*   Discussions on the EAT "class identifier" claim and other minor technical points will continue on the mailing list.
*   Further discussions regarding Attestation Results and Attestation Sets can be continued on the mailing list.
