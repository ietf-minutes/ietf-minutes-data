## Summary
The teas working group session at IETF 112 covered an update on the general status of working group documents, including several drafts nearing Last Call. Detailed presentations and discussions focused on updates to the `ietf-te-vpn`, `ietf-te-telemetry`, and `ietf-te-service-mapping` Yang models. A significant portion of the session was dedicated to a technical discussion on the different types of connectivity matrices defined in the `ietf-te-framework` document, prompting questions about terminology, scope, and the relationship between service abstraction and network realization.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Working Group Status Updates (Pawan Biram)**:
    *   **General**: No new RFCs, but a batch of documents are moving towards Working Group Last Call. One document (signaling extensions for some pivot) is in the publication request queue. One new document adoption.
    *   `ietf-enhanced-vpn-framework`: A new revision was published detailing applicability to network slicing. The chairs noted that Enhanced VPN offers one solution approach for IETF network slices but is not the sole approach. Authors are encouraged to use the mailing list or open discussion time to clarify the relationship with IETF network slices.
    *   `ietf-pcc-use-cases`: The chairs decided to move this document to Working Group Last Call. Authors are completing pending items, and working group review is requested.
    *   `rfc3272bis`: A new revision was published. An open question remains on whether to change the scope from "Overview and Principles of Internet Traffic Engineering" to "Overview and Principles of Traffic Engineering." Further input and reviews are requested due to a lack of previous discussion.
    *   `ietf-sf-aware-topology-yang`: Authors requested a Yang Doctors review, which has been initiated.
    *   `ietf-te-base-yang`: Authors requested Working Group Last Call. The plan is to proceed with this document first, with the RSVP and MPLS Yang documents to follow. IPR disclosure for this document has begun.
    *   **Administrative**: A reminder was given for co-authors to verify email addresses, as one author's email was bouncing.

*   **`ietf-te-vpn` Yang Model Updates (Dhruv Dhody)**:
    *   This model describes the customer's view of a virtual network, abstracting TE topology and tunnel models.
    *   **Updates**: Cleaned up naming conventions, added an empty `underlay` container for future augmentations (e.g., SR policy details), refined the `vn-compute-status` description, included `cos` (Class of Service, reusing `te-types` `dst-class-type`) as an additional constraint, and updated JSON examples.
    *   **Discussion**: The `cos` constraint needs more descriptive text in the document. The approach of using an empty container for future extensibility requires further working group review.

*   **`ietf-te-telemetry` Yang Model Updates (Dhruv Dhody)**:
    *   This model focuses on performance monitoring parameters and scaling intent mechanisms for VN/TE.
    *   **Updates**: Term "kpi" was removed for simplicity, figures depicting model relationships were clarified, an XML example for scaling was added, the term "proactive" was removed from re-optimization discussions, and security considerations were updated. Linkage with OPS area VPN service performance measurement work was also clarified.
    *   **Discussion**: It was noted that the Yang Doctors review process, which includes ADs from the OPS area, would address any terminology overlaps regarding "intent." The model specifically covers transport (TE/VN) telemetry, not service telemetry.

*   **`ietf-te-service-mapping` Yang Model Updates (Dhruv Dhody)**:
    *   This model maps various services (L3SM, L2SM, L1CSM) and network models to TE infrastructure (topology, tunnel, VN).
    *   **Updates**: Clarified the purpose and usage scenarios (e.g., external vs. internal network use). Explicitly stated that scheduling and traffic mapping are out of scope for this document.
    *   **Discussion**:
        *   **IETF Network Slice**: The working group chairs suggested keeping IETF network slice mapping out of scope for this document to avoid delays and allow it to be addressed through a future augmentation if needed. The authors will discuss this internally.
        *   **"Out of Scope" Statements**: A concern was raised by the chair about explicitly stating items as "out of scope," as this could inadvertently hinder future augmentations. It was suggested that documents often remain silent on topics outside their scope unless there's a strong reason to explicitly exclude them. This will be discussed further on the mailing list.

*   **`ietf-te-framework` Connectivity Matrix (Adrian Farrel)**:
    *   Revision 05 of the framework attempts to resolve open issues concerning connectivity matrices.
    *   **Updates**: Clarified definitions for Point-to-Point (P2P), Bi-directional P2P, Point-to-Multipoint (P2MP), and Multipoint-to-Point (MP2P). A new Any-to-Any (A2A) matrix was added to support various operator use cases, including VPN-type services, which behave as a rootable full mesh rather than traditional tunnels.
    *   **Discussion**:
        *   **Terminology**: Discussion ensued on the definition of "connectivity matrix" and "connections," with calls for alignment with the `te-topology` model or explicit divergence.
        *   **Grouping**: A suggestion was made to treat P2P and P2MP as fundamental types and categorize others (like hub-and-spoke or MP2MP) as groupings or derivations, rather than distinct matrix types.
        *   **Bi-directional P2P**: It was generally agreed that bi-directional P2P remains an important service to call out separately.
        *   **SLOs/SLEs**: Questions arose about the implicit derivation of receiver SLOs/SLEs from senders, and whether receivers should be able to define their own.
        *   **Multi-homing**: The concept of multi-homing (multiple CEs for a receiver) was introduced as a factor that further complicates SLO definitions.
        *   **CE Definition**: The definition of "Customer Endpoint (CE)" was questioned, particularly in contexts where it might refer to a service delivery point within the network or a Provider Edge (PE) device, highlighting a need for clearer scope.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Decision**: The `ietf-pcc-use-cases` document will proceed to Working Group Last Call soon.
*   **Decision**: The `ietf-te-base-yang` document will proceed to Working Group Last Call first, with other RSVP and MPLS Yang documents to follow.
*   **Action Item**: Dhruv Dhody to add more descriptive text for the `cos` constraint in the `ietf-te-vpn` Yang model.
*   **Action Item**: Dhruv Dhody to discuss with co-authors and the working group (on the mailing list) regarding the inclusion or removal of explicit "out of scope" paragraphs in the `ietf-te-service-mapping` document.
*   **Action Item**: Co-authors of working group documents are requested to verify and correct all author and contributor email addresses, as one was found to be bouncing.

## Next Steps

*   Working Group members are encouraged to review `ietf-pcc-use-cases` in anticipation of its Last Call.
*   Working Group members are encouraged to review `rfc3272bis`, particularly providing input on the proposed scope change.
*   Working Group members are encouraged to review `ietf-te-base-yang` for its upcoming Last Call, and subsequently the RSVP and MPLS Yang drafts.
*   Discussion on the `teas` mailing list is encouraged for:
    *   Clarifying the relationship between `ietf-enhanced-vpn-framework` and IETF network slices.
    *   Reviewing the use of empty containers for future augmentation in `ietf-te-vpn`.
    *   Further discussion on the "out of scope" statements in `ietf-te-service-mapping`.
*   A Yang Doctors review for `ietf-te-telemetry` will be initiated, which will include review by ADs from the OPS area to address terminology.
*   Authors of `ietf-te-service-mapping` will consider adding more examples to the document.
*   Offline discussion between Adrian Farrel and Tarik will take place to align terminology for connectivity matrices with the `te-topology` model.
*   Further discussion is anticipated on the precise definition and implications of "Customer Endpoint (CE)" within the context of the `ietf-te-framework` and network slicing.
