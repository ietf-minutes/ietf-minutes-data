# tsvwg

## Summary

The tsvwg session covered updates on working group documents, milestone discussions, and a critical deep-dive into the L4S Working Group Last Call (WGLC) status and draft revisions. A significant portion of the meeting was dedicated to the L4S documents, addressing concerns raised during the WGLC, particularly regarding the experimental vs. standards track approach, alignment with RFC 4774, and risk assessment. An important reminder about the IETF Code of Conduct was also provided, emphasizing constructive communication and clarity, especially concerning the historically contentious L4S discussions.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Logistics and Housekeeping:**
    *   Magnus volunteered as note taker.
    *   Reminder about the IETF Note Well and IPR disclosure.
    *   Guidance for submitting drafts (add `tsvwg` to ID title) and using MeetEcho.
    *   Call for document reviews, specifically for UDP options and DSCP-related drafts.
*   **Document Status Updates:**
    *   No RFCs published since the last meeting.
    *   SCTP 4960bis sent to the Area Director (AD).
    *   SCTP NAT document being revised based on AD comments.
    *   ECN Encapsulation and ECN for Tunnels drafts are very close to AD submission but require final text adjustments from Bob and David, having been delayed by L4S work.
    *   Three L4S-related documents (Architecture, Dual Queue Coupled, L4S ID) underwent a Working Group Last Call (WGLC).
    *   Other in-progress drafts include: Operational Guidance on L4S, NQB DiffServ PHB, UDP Options, Datagram PLPMTUD for UDP Options, DTLS with SCTP updates (with ongoing IPR disclosure discussions), DiffServ Default DSCP Selection, and adopted Multipath DCCP work.
*   **Milestones:**
    *   NQB PHB target submission: April.
    *   UDP Options and Datagram PLPMTUD for UDP Options target submission: May.
    *   New milestones are needed for Multipath DCCP, DTLS SCTP, and Considerations for Signing New DSCPs. Chairs will work with authors offline.
*   **Liaisons:**
    *   WBA liaison response sent, no further updates.
    *   tsvwg will likely take over maintenance of TRAM working group activities (behave and NAT) upon its closure.
*   **Code of Conduct Reminder:**
    *   The IAB and IESG are recommitting to improving the tone of IETF conversations.
    *   Emphasis on limiting slang, especially when speaking to a diverse audience, and fostering an environment conducive to newcomers and differing opinions.
    *   Attendees were encouraged to reflect on their own conduct rather than past grievances.
    *   Bob noted that contentious discussions (e.g., L4S) often move off-list, indicating an environment not conducive to open discourse.
*   **L4S Working Group Last Call (WGLC) Status:**
    *   WGLC for Architecture, Dual Queue Coupled, and L4S ID drafts ran from late July to late August. The Operational Guidance draft was excluded.
    *   The WGLC generated a high volume of responses, indicating strong overall support, but also well-explained concerns.
    *   **Top Concerns Identified by Chairs:**
        1.  **Experimental vs. Standards Track:** Consensus lacking for L4S to go standards track *now*. Working group needs to sketch out long-term plans for IESG if the experimental path is successful, to clarify future intent.
        2.  **RFC 4774 Alignment:** Unclear how L4S aligns with RFC 4774 recommendations. Bob posted updates, but Jonathan argued the description of L4S conforming to option 3 is inaccurate, stating the divergence is more serious. David acknowledged L4S does not fully comply and that the extent of divergence needs sorting on the list.
        3.  **Risk Analysis Disagreement:** Varying perceptions of implementation risks and potential problems. The working group needs to confirm acceptance of the risks associated with L4S experimentation.
    *   Lesser criticality concerns, such as specific dual queue construction details, are considered optional and not blocking the overall architecture.
*   **L4S Draft Updates (Bob):**
    *   L4S aims for high-fidelity congestion control, enabling low delay and high utilization simultaneously.
    *   **Ongoing testing:** Pete Heist's testing with Jonathan's "red team" characterization, focusing on bursts.
    *   **Linux fq_codel patch:** Tokay and Eric Dumazet implemented a patch allowing fq_codel to set a shallow ECN threshold specifically for ECT(1) packets, with ECT(0) packets processed by deeper codel machinery.
    *   **Apple's ECN experiments:** Stewart's emails on Apple's ECN experiments were highlighted as important reading.
    *   **WGLC Comment Resolution:** Bob reported attempting to address all review points, including correcting a mischaracterization of Linux Cubic response which led to a significantly longer Appendix C in the Dual Queue draft.
    *   **Process clarification:** David requested Bob to send a list of reviewers whose comments did not lead to direct draft changes but still require acknowledgment and discussion.
    *   **L4S Architecture Draft:** No normative changes; considerable editorial rewriting for clarity, including interactions with rate policing.
    *   **L4S Coupled Dual Queue and L4S ID Drafts (Normative Changes):**
        *   **RFC 4774 Compliance/Classic ECN AQM Detection (Sec 4.3):** Ongoing discussion with Jake regarding text conditioning on "problems" vs. sender actions. A new subsection justifies L4S compliance/non-compliance with RFCs.
        *   **ECN Field Handling:** Text modified for in-flight nodes to treat CE as ECT(0) *only if all previous packets* were ECT(0), raising concerns about transient flow state.
        *   **Operator Control:** Clarified normative statements to refer to "the process of including additional traffic" rather than network-wide operator actions.
        *   **Excluding L4S Users:** Discussion needed on whether operators "must not" treat ECT(1) as ECT(0) for excluded L4S users for commercial/security reasons.
*   **Open L4S Discussion:**
    *   **Stewart (Apple):** Emphasized the critical importance of fixing latency under load, arguing current internet might be superseded if this isn't addressed. He is less concerned about backward compatibility with classic ECN (RFC 3168), which he characterized as having "failed" due to lack of deployment.
    *   **Jonathan:** Disputed the "failed" characterization, stating many ECN-compatible nodes exist, but endpoints don't use it, and network operators rarely mark packets. He suggested Stewart's ECN heuristics might be misleading.
    *   **Jake:** Agreed there are tens of millions of deployed devices that cause issues due to backward incompatibility in signaling, even if marking is infrequent.
*   **L4S Operational Guidance Draft (Greg):**
    *   Presented a quick overview of recent edits, including a title change for Section 6.2 (from "Less preferred options" to "Non-preferred options").
    *   The draft is not yet ready for WGLC. Greg requested reviews and suggestions to the mailing list.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Decision:** Magnus to serve as note taker for the session.
*   **Action Item:** Working Group Chairs to work with authors offline to set appropriate milestones for Multipath DCCP, DTLS SCTP, and the DSCP considerations draft.
*   **Action Item:** David and Bob to finalize updates for the ECN Encapsulation and ECN for Tunnels drafts for submission to the Area Director.
*   **Action Item:** Bob to send a summary to the mailing list listing reviewers whose L4S WGLC comments did not result in direct draft changes but still need to be addressed at a higher process level.
*   **Action Item:** Chairs and editors to continue working through the top L4S WGLC concerns: clarifying long-term plans for L4S (experimental vs. standards track), achieving consensus on RFC 4774 alignment, and confirming working group acceptance of L4S experimentation risks.
*   **Action Item:** Discussion on L4S alignment with RFC 4774 and the precise handling of the ECN field by in-flight nodes to continue on the mailing list.
*   **Action Item:** Reviewers to provide feedback and suggestions for further enhancements to the L4S Operational Guidance draft on the mailing list.

## Next Steps

*   Continue detailed discussions and revisions for the L4S WGLC drafts on the mailing list, focusing on the identified top concerns.
*   Finalize and submit the ECN Encapsulation and ECN for Tunnels drafts.
*   Set milestones for recently adopted and new work items.
*   Prepare other non-L4S drafts for discussion at upcoming meetings or via the mailing list.
*   Greg hopes to present on the NQB drafts at the beginning of the next session if discussion time is needed, otherwise, the mailing list is the primary channel.
