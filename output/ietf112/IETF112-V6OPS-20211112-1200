# v6ops

## Summary

This joint v6ops and 6man session focused on the long-standing operational issues with the IPv6 Hop-by-Hop (HBH) Extension Header and discussed potential paths for its rehabilitation. The discussion highlighted how HBH is frequently filtered or dropped due to its historical association with Denial of Service (DoS) vectors and slow-path processing in older router architectures. Several proposed solutions were presented, including re-defining HBH processing rules to ensure fast-path handling, specifying limits on extension header usage, and exploring compelling use cases. There was strong consensus among participants to proceed with efforts to make HBH options viable and to break the cycle of non-use and filtering, while acknowledging the challenges of migration and existing deployments.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Introduction and Goals (Ron):**
    *   The Hop-by-Hop (HBH) Extension Header has been specified since 1995 (RFC 1882) and later in RFC 2460.
    *   The Router Alert option (RFC 2711) was an early, unfortunate application, often punting packets to the control plane, making HBH a DoS vector.
    *   This led to network operators filtering HBH packets, creating a cycle of non-use.
    *   RFC 8200 changed the expectation: nodes should only process HBH if *explicitly configured* to do so, but this has not significantly improved the situation.
    *   Goals of the session: Determine if RFC 8200's specification is sufficient, if the situation can improve without changes, and whether to rehabilitate or deprecate HBH. Also, to re-examine existing HBH options and identify necessary documents.

*   **"Operational Issues with Processing of Hop-by-Hop Extension Headers" (Guillermo/Dion Mishra):**
    *   This newly adopted draft focuses solely on HBH issues, unlike RFC 1998 which is generic to all extension headers.
    *   **Problem Statement:** HBH is often misidentified as a DoS vector, leading to slow-path processing, dropping, or filtering by operators. The goal is to make HBH viable.
    *   **Draft Updates:** Renamed, solution-space content removed (especially from sections 7 and 8) to make it problem-focused and generalized for WG involvement.
    *   **Future Work:** Refine requirements in Section 7, develop migration strategies (Section 8), and explore new network scenarios/use cases (Enterprise, IoT).
    *   **Motivation:** HBH is a valuable container for new services like telemetry (e.g., IPPM). Operators need this tool in a safe, secure, and easily deployable manner.
    *   **Modern Router Architecture:** Newer hardware (MPUs, ASICs) with strict control/forwarding plane separation and rate-limiting can process HBH at line rate in the forwarding plane, mitigating past DoS concerns.
    *   **Common Implementations:** `Next Header = 0` (HBH) often defaults to the slow path, leading to ACL filtering or dropping.
    *   **RFC 8200 Impact:** While it allowed local configuration to avoid processing HBH (or ignore/drop/punt), it has not significantly enabled HBH deployment due to existing operator mindsets.
    *   **Conclusion:** Need to break the cycle of filtering, change operator perception, and enable viable HBH solutions.

*   **"Hop-by-Hop Option Processing Procedures" (Bob Hinden & Gorry Fairhurst):**
    *   **Issue:** HBH options are commonly dropped due to fear of slow-path processing.
    *   **Proposal:** Simplify HBH usage and redefine procedures to make it practical.
    *   **Proposed Rules:**
        *   One HBH option *must* be processed on the fast path.
        *   Additional HBH options *may* be processed if configured.
        *   Nodes creating packets should preferably include a single HBH option.
        *   Nodes can skip remaining HBH options without examination.
        *   Nodes unable to fast-path process an HBH option must treat it as unrecognized (unless explicitly configured).
        *   The Router Alert option is considered an *exception* as it inherently directs to the slow path.
    *   **Implications for New HBH Options:** Must be designed for fast-path processing (straightforward, fixed size, minimal data).
    *   **Open Issues:** Clear definition of "fast path" vs. "slow path." How to handle multiple HBH options in a packet (the second one might not be processed by default).
    *   **Next Steps:** Seeking 6man working group adoption for this draft. Need compelling use cases to drive implementation (e.g., Path MTU).

*   **"Limits on IPv6 Extension Headers" (Tom Herbert):**
    *   **Problem:** Support for IPv6 Extension Headers (EHs) is poor. RFC 8200 has no limits on the number of EHs or options, only on total packet MTU, which allows for excessive, DoS-like EH chains.
    *   **Hardware Challenge:** Variable-length TLVs are difficult for hardware to process efficiently due to their serialized nature.
    *   **Hidden Problem:** Routers often need to read L4 headers (e.g., ports). Long EH chains can push L4 headers beyond a fixed-size parsing buffer, leading to drops.
    *   **Proposal:** Specify limits for both sending and receiving EHs.
        *   **Processing Limits:** Number of EHs, number of options within HBH/DO, length of options.
        *   **Total Header Length Limit:** To ensure L4 headers remain accessible.
        *   **Sender Limits:** Default limits, can be exceeded only if "safe" (e.g., within a limited domain or via active probing).
        *   **Receiver Limits:** Optional, with suggested defaults (e.g., 8 HBH/DO options).
    *   **Behavior on Exceeding Limits:** Intermediate nodes should *ignore* excess HBH options, not drop. End hosts are expected to process all.
    *   **Implementation:** These limits, though adding conditionals, can be integrated into high-performance hardware EH processing.
    *   **Next Steps:** Interested in feedback on working group adoption.

*   **Example Use Cases (Lightning Talks):**
    *   **Path MTU HBH Option (Bob Hinden & Gorry Fairhurst):** An experimental RFC for Path MTU Discovery. Routers along the path can update a minimum MTU value in the HBH option, which is returned to the source. This provides rapid feedback on path MTU and can work even if not all routers process it.
    *   **IOAM with HBH (Haoyu Song):** In-situ Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (IOAM) requires per-hop processing, making HBH a natural fit. Challenges include potentially large, variable overhead, exceeding hardware header buffer limits, and impacting subsequent headers like SRv6 Segment Routing Header (SRH). Proposed solutions involve separating IOAM instruction/data, segmenting data collection, or direct export mechanisms.
    *   **Alternate Marking HBH Option (Giuseppe Fioccola):** A passive performance measurement technique (loss, delay flags) for IPv6. The source marks the packet, and intermediate nodes read it if configured. It's intended for controlled domains, and ignoring the option doesn't affect the measurement logic.
    *   **VTN Resource Identifier HBH Option (Jianli Wang):** For Virtual Underlay Networks (VTNs) (e.g., network slicing), a VTN identifier needs to be carried in the data packet and processed per-hop to steer traffic to allocated resources. HBH is proposed for this. It's designed for controlled, limited domains.

*   **Open Discussion and Decisions:**
    *   **Eduard:** Expressed skepticism about IETF's ability to "enforce" HBH processing and resistance to arbitrary numerical restrictions. He supported architectural changes like separating "soft" (control plane) and "hard" (data plane) options.
    *   **General Sentiment:** Strong support for continuing efforts to rehabilitate HBH, with a focus on finding compelling use cases to drive operator adoption. There was general agreement that HBH should not be deprecated without strong evidence of danger.
    *   **RFC 8200 Effectiveness:** Several noted that RFC 8200 (allowing ignored HBH) did not visibly improve HBH deployment. The default "punt to control plane" behavior remains a problem.
    *   **"Internet-wide" vs. "Limited Domains":** Debate arose on whether "limited domain" use cases (RPL, DETNET, VTN, Alternate Marking) qualify as "internet-wide interest." Pascal argued that many limited domains collectively constitute significant interest.
    *   **Migration Strategy:** Emphasized as critical for any solution, ensuring coexistence of new and old devices.
    *   **Re-examining Existing HBH Options:**
        *   **"Dead Wood":** General agreement that a review of old, unused HBH options is beneficial, particularly regarding their size implications.
        *   **Router Alert:** This option was specifically called out due to its behavior of punting to the control plane.
            *   Concerns were raised about deprecating it outright, as it is still used by existing protocols (e.g., MLDv2, L2 equipment).
            *   A suggestion was made to define deprecation in this context as "don't use for new protocols or on general internet paths, but allow for specific existing protocols."
            *   Eduard highlighted the general IETF problem of scattered information across many RFCs, making it hard for operators to understand nuances.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Decision:** There was a strong consensus within the session to **proceed with the rehabilitation of the Hop-by-Hop Extension Header**, focusing on making it viable for future use cases rather than deprecating it.
*   **Action Item (Chairs):** The chairs will take the discussion to the relevant mailing lists (v6ops, 6man) to initiate working group adoption calls for the "Operational Issues with Processing of Hop-by-Hop Extension Headers" and "Hop-by-Hop Option Processing Procedures" drafts.
*   **Action Item (Fred G. Baker):** Will work on a BCP (Best Current Practice) draft for ignoring HBH options, complementing the proposed solutions.

## Next Steps

*   **Mailing List Discussions:** Further detailed technical discussions on the proposed drafts and open issues (e.g., definition of fast/slow path, specific limits, Router Alert handling) will continue on the v6ops and 6man mailing lists.
*   **Document Progression:**
    *   The "Operational Issues with Processing of Hop-by-Hop Extension Headers" draft will continue to refine its requirements section and develop migration strategies.
    *   The "Hop-by-Hop Option Processing Procedures" draft will address open issues and seek working group adoption.
    *   Consideration of a dedicated document or section to comprehensively address requirements for HBH options.
    *   Discussion on a potential "housekeeping" document to re-examine or deprecate existing, unused, or problematic HBH options (such as Router Alert), with careful consideration of backwards compatibility and specific protocol uses.
*   **Community Engagement:** All participants are encouraged to read the presented drafts, provide feedback, and contribute to the ongoing discussions to help shape the future of HBH processing in IPv6.
