## Summary

The RATS working group session focused on updates for several key drafts, including CHArA, Event Stream Subscription, AR4SI, Architecture, DAA, Interaction Models, UCCS, EAT, and RIV. A significant portion of the session was dedicated to discussing a proposed charter update, which generated considerable debate regarding protocol scope and the definition of attestation results. Lawrence presented a taxonomy for EAT and attestation results, prompting a detailed discussion on the roles of verifiers and relying parties, and the spectrum of security strengths and system architectures that attestation results should accommodate. While no major new decisions were made on technical drafts, the charter discussion was deferred to the mailing list for further consensus.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **CHArA (Composed Hierarchical Attestation):**
    *   Draft is at version 18, undergoing ISG review.
    *   Two discusses remain, believed to be minor and addressed; one more ISG vote needed for closure.
    *   Changes include adding an IMA appendix, reference updates, and XPath syntax tweaks.
    *   Action requested for Roman to get the discusses addressed before ballot turnover on Wednesday.

*   **Event Stream Subscription:**
    *   Stable, depends on CHArA for progression.
    *   Aims to provide verifiable fresh evidence streams from TPMs, avoiding challenge-response for PCR changes.
    *   Expected to proceed to Working Group Last Call (WGLC) after CHArA completes ISG review.

*   **AR4SI (Attestation Results for Secure Interactions):**
    *   Adopted by the working group since IETF 112.
    *   Now adopted by the Confidential Compute Consortium.
    *   Text clarifications made on trustworthiness claims values.
    *   Mailing list discussions compared AR4SI claims with EAT security and software results.
    *   Trusted Path Routing document aligning but not requesting adoption yet due to lack of market uptake.
    *   Highlighted design principles for AR (explicit states, clear definitions, extensibility).
    *   Discussion on a comparison table for executable/filesystem trustworthiness claims vs. EAT software results, emphasizing commonality in claim design.

*   **RATS Architecture:**
    *   Document has no remaining issues (185 resolved pull requests).
    *   Currently in a "limbo state" of being submitted to ISG.
    *   Roman (AD) confirmed it's in pub req queue; he will perform an early review and then trigger IETF Last Call and directorate reviews. No further edits by authors until next action from ISG.

*   **DAA (Direct Anonymous Attestation):**
    *   Adopted as a standalone document after splitting from the interaction model draft.
    *   Next steps include:
        *   Fleshing out relationship with RATS endorser.
        *   Elaborating on the TCG Privacy CA concept.
        *   Correlating with the DICE concept for trust chain consumption.
    *   Discussion on DAA's applicability beyond TPMs (e.g., FIDO, EAT, KOSE). Clarification needed on use cases for group attestation where individuality is not desired, contrasting privacy (cell phones) with scale (IoT sensors).

*   **Interaction Models:**
    *   Covers challenge/response, subscription, and time-based models.
    *   C2PA (Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity) project is driving the implementation of background check and passport combinations, leading to their inclusion.
    *   Working group asked to review for maturity and consider early last call or early review.

*   **UCCS (Unprotected Claims in CoAP Security):**
    *   Appendix added to accommodate JSON/CBOR with CDDL (using "feature" and "generic" capabilities).
    *   Working group discussion initiated on whether to rename to UJCS (Unprotected JSON Claims/CBOR Claims) to reflect JSON support.
    *   Emphasis on bundling with a prescriptive threat model and security considerations, making it relevant to RATS despite general applicability to CWTS.

*   **EAT (Evidence Attestation Token):**
    *   Dash-12 draft has most items "green" (ready for last call), except for measurements and results.
    *   Key changes: hardware model claim, boot odometer claim, privacy considerations, IANA section filled.
    *   Planning for dash-13 includes grouping claims (entity, token metadata, nonce, public keys) and completing CDDL for JSON/CBOR generics.
    *   Open consensus items: normative dependency on UCCS, the "security level" claim, and its role in attestation results (profile vs. general code, relation to AR4SI).
    *   Good news: early IANA allocation for EAT claims has been approved.

*   **RIV (Remote Integrity Verification):**
    *   Discuss comments resolved. A few non-blocking comments remain for resolution.
    *   Expected to go to RFC editor once comments are addressed.
    *   Follows the background check model; does not explicitly include relying party interaction.

*   **Charter Discussion:**
    *   Proposed rechartering text was presented, expanding the program of work to include "standardized interoperable data formats to securely declare and convey endorsements and reference values" (item 6). Minor cleanup on other items.
    *   A poll indicated low readership of the proposed text (8 out of 24 participants).
    *   Discussion on the asymmetry in point 5 of the program of work (protocols for attester-verifier vs. reusing for verifier-relying party). Consensus to clarify that existing protocols should be preferred, but without precluding new ones if justified.
    *   Lawrence raised concern about ensuring EAT is not implicitly excluded as an attestation results protocol.
    *   Chairs updated the text live on GitHub to reflect the preference for existing protocols.

*   **Milestones:**
    *   Chairs acknowledged being behind on milestone updates.
    *   Roman (AD) requested the working group to pipeline work correctly, avoiding starting too many things at once and suggesting "waves or sprints" of related work for productivity.

*   **Taxonomy, EAT, Attestation and Results Taxonomy (Lawrence):**
    *   **Scope of Attestation Results:** Should support a full range of security strengths (from simple authenticated identity to TPM/TEE based) and system architectures (purpose-built hardware, app-based, hybrid).
    *   **Verifier vs. Relying Party Roles:** A key discussion point. Lawrence argued that the verifier's role is device integrity/trustworthiness, while the relying party applies domain-specific policy (e.g., transaction amount, application context). Eric agreed, emphasizing relying party as a role, not physical item. Brendan suggested a multi-stage verification (two verifiers + relying party). Hank stated the verifier is well-defined in the architecture, making policy decisions that the relying party consumes.
    *   **Interaction between Verifier and Relying Party:** Suggested JSON + TLS for B2B interactions, without needing extensive new standards.
    *   **Device Identity:** Discussion on what constitutes "device identity" (OEM, model, serial number, version) versus "identifier" (UEID, UUIDs, industry-specific). Hank noted CoRIM's extensive list of identifiers.
    *   **"Verified Forwarded Claims":** Proposed term for attester claims passed from verifier to relying party, subject to verifier's policy (not a blind "pass-through").

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **CHArA:** Roman (AD) to contact Rob Wilton to re-evaluate his discuss comments, aiming for resolution before Wednesday's ballot turnover.
*   **RATS Architecture:** Roman (AD) to perform an early review and then trigger the IETF Last Call and directorate reviews after IETF week.
*   **Charter Discussion:** Chairs to conduct another poll and call for support on the mailing list for the proposed rechartering text, which was updated during the session to clarify the preference for reusing existing protocols.
*   **Milestones:** Working group to review and update milestones to reflect current draft status and consider Roman's advice on pipelining work.

## Next Steps

*   **CHArA:** Address remaining ISG discusses for publication.
*   **Event Stream Subscription:** Await CHArA publication, then proceed to WGLC.
*   **AR4SI:** Continue internal development and mailing list discussions.
*   **RATS Architecture:** Await AD review and IETF Last Call.
*   **DAA:** Authors to continue fleshing out relationships with endorsers, Privacy CA, and DICE, and consider broader applicability.
*   **Interaction Models:** Working group review, consider early last call.
*   **UCCS:** Working group discussion on renaming to UJCS and formalizing JSON/CBOR support.
*   **EAT:** Complete CDDL, group claims in dash-13, resolve consensus items (UCCS dependency, security level, AR role).
*   **RIV:** Address remaining minor comments for RFC editor submission.
*   **Charter:** Further discussion and poll on the mailing list.
*   **Taxonomy & Roles:** Continue discussions on the mailing list regarding verifier/relying party roles and the scope of attestation results and device identity.
