## Summary

The rats working group session addressed three main topics: the relationship and dependencies between the EAT (Evidence Attestation Token) and UCCS (Unsigned CBOR/JSON Claim Set) documents, the relevance of private key extractability in attestation for cloud environments, and the proposal for CoRIM (Concise Reference Integrity Manifests). A key decision was made regarding the EAT/UCCS dependency, guiding EAT authors to move normative UCCS content to informative references. Discussions on private key extractability indicated a preference for handling this in dedicated profiles rather than EAT itself. The CoRIM presentation received positive feedback, with a plan to revisit adoption once the working group's charter is updated.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **EAT and UCCS Relationship**
    *   **Presentation by Gidi (EAT Editors)**:
        *   UCCS is scoped to attestation, covering both unsigned CBOR and JSON claim sets.
        *   UCCS does not normatively require a mutually authenticated secure transport; EAT is silent on transport requirements.
        *   EAT has a normative dependency on UCCS's definition and a stable CDDL description.
        *   **Editors' Recommendation**: EAT to provide the CDDL description for unsigned claim sets (for CWT and JWT) and incorporate the CBOR/JSON tag. The current UCCS document would refocus on security considerations for unsigned claims, potentially moving to an informational track and covering attestation results beyond just evidence.
        *   **Rationale**: EAT needs a stable CDDL, UCCS security considerations are evolving and complex, and to avoid holding up EAT's progress.
    *   **Discussion**:
        *   **Dave Taylor**: Asked if UCCS could apply to attestation *results* (beyond evidence), suggesting an amendment to UCCS introduction for broader applicability. Gidi confirmed this could be considered.
        *   **Roman**: Clarified if UCCS security considerations would be normative or informative. Gidi stated they would be informative due to the evolving nature of use cases.
        *   **Kathleen (Chair)**: Expressed concern about timeline impacts if UCCS content were folded into EAT. Gidi clarified only the CDDL description would be incorporated, not the entire UCCS document.
        *   **Carsten**: Raised a fundamental concern about EAT potentially pulling CWT's general-purpose nature into the RATS scope, advocating for clean separation between CWT as a basic mechanism and EAT extensions. Noted practical problems with section 8 of EAT.
        *   **Hank**: Emphasized that UCCS is for CWT within an attestation context (RATS charter), stressing the importance of context for its safe use. Reaffirmed UCCS is dangerous without prescribed usage and threat models.

*   **Attestation for Cloud (Private Key Extractability)**
    *   **Presentation by Gidi**:
        *   Highlighted an emerging issue: cloud synchronization of private keys, particularly for authentication credentials (e.g., FIDO).
        *   Noted that FIDO authenticators may not have the architectural separation between attester and target environment assumed by the current RATS architecture, as keys might be extractable.
        *   **Question to WG**: Should attestation evidence (specifically EAT) address whether private key material (especially attestation keys) is extractable?
        *   **Proposed Ways Forward**:
            1.  Define relevant evidence entry claims in EAT (if of general interest).
            2.  Leave the issue to a profile for FIDO-compliant authenticators.
            3.  Do nothing, let the Relying Party (RP) determine appraisal via implicit evidence or other means.
    *   **Discussion**:
        *   **Hank**: Expressed concern about key extractability, stating it's dangerous without trustworthy endorsements.
        *   **Dave Taylor**: Favored leaving the issue to a specific profile (option 2).
        *   **Lawrence**: Differentiated between FIDO authentication keys (FIDO's concern) and attestation keys (relevant to RATS), suggesting export of attestation keys is a major issue for this group.
        *   **Tony Natoli**: Recommended doing nothing in this space, letting FIDO or profile creators handle it.
        *   **Chair Guidance**: Gidi to post on the mailing list to solicit interest and further discussion for solutions outside the EAT core document.

*   **CoRIM (Concise Reference Integrity Manifests)**
    *   **Presentation by Thomas**:
        *   **Goal**: Provide a standard information and data model for supply chain actors (OEMs, ISVs, etc.) to describe an attester to a verifier, enabling evidence appraisal. Aims to reduce fragmentation and lower barriers to entry.
        *   **Scope**: Focuses on endorsement and reference values flowing into the verifier (as per RATS architecture diagram). CoRIM defines payloads, not transport.
        *   **Design Principles**: Describes attesters using simple "triples" (subject-verb-object), serialized in CBOR (concise), and signed with COSE. Extensible set of triples.
        *   **Status**: Information model stable (TCG DICE working group consensus), data model maintained in GitHub (CDDL, examples), and a software implementation exists (Golang library, CLI).
        *   **Question**: Once the proposed new RATS charter (which includes CoRIM scope) is in place, would CoRIM be considered for adoption?
    *   **Discussion**:
        *   **Dave Taylor**: Supported CoRIM's appropriateness for RATS if the charter passes. Highlighted its primary value for defining *reference values* due to the need for sets of values and verbs. Suggested potentially scoping the work to focus on the "reference value provider" line.
        *   **Hank**: Agreed endorsements can exist independently, but reference values need pointers to endorsers. Believes CoRIM can accommodate the separation between endorsers and reference value providers. Mentioned a corresponding profile, the PSA endorsement token, is already being developed.
        *   **Lawrence**: Noted the need for reference values to correlate with measurements in evidence and confirmed CoRIM (which contains CoMID schema) is compatible with EAT's plug-in formats for measurements.
        *   **Chair Guidance**: Adoption cannot happen before charter update. Chairs will solicit review feedback from the working group on the mailing list *after* the charter is updated, before a formal call for adoption. Acknowledged previous interest from the mailing list.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **EAT and UCCS Circular Dependency**:
    *   **Decision**: The working group expressed consensus (via poll) that normative content regarding UCCS should be removed from the EAT specification and changed to be informative. This guidance is intended to accelerate EAT's progress towards RFC publication.
    *   **Action Item**: EAT authors are directed to revise the EAT draft to move normative UCCS-related content to informative references. The chairs will further clarify on the mailing list the specific handling of the UCCS CDDL (e.g., if EAT should define its own, reference CWT's, or use an informative reference to UCCS).
*   **Attestation for Cloud (Private Key Extractability)**:
    *   **Decision**: The working group did not express interest in incorporating private key extractability claims directly into the EAT core document at this time.
    *   **Action Item**: Gidi to post on the mailing list to gauge further interest for addressing private key extractability in a dedicated profile or solution outside of EAT core.
*   **CoRIM (Concise Reference Integrity Manifests)**:
    *   **Decision**: The document cannot be adopted at this time as its scope is not yet covered by the current RATS charter. Positive interest was noted from the group.
    *   **Action Item**: Thomas (CoRIM author) to await the update of the RATS working group charter. Once the charter update is complete, the chairs will solicit review and feedback on the CoRIM draft from the working group on the mailing list, prior to a formal call for adoption.

## Next Steps

*   EAT authors to update the EAT draft as per the guidance regarding UCCS dependencies. Chairs will provide further clarification on CDDL handling for EAT via the mailing list.
*   Gidi to post on the mailing list seeking further interest and direction for addressing private key extractability in cloud environments.
*   The working group awaits the charter update, after which the CoRIM document will be subject to a review and feedback period on the mailing list before a call for adoption.
