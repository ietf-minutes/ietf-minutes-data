# TEAS Session Minutes - IETF 113 Vienna

## Summary

The TEAS working group discussed various drafts related to IETF Network Slices, including updates to common TE types, solutions for realizing network slices, service delivery models, use cases, scalability considerations, and YANG models for Network Resource Partitions (NRPs). Key discussions revolved around the adoption of several drafts, the alignment of terminology (NRP vs. VTN), the relationship between different YANG models for NRPs, and the practical deployment experiences of operators. A central theme was ensuring consistency and identifying gaps in existing IETF tools for network slicing.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Updates to Common TE Types (RFC 8776):**
    *   Proposed minor, backward-compatible updates to `ietf-te-types` module in RFC 8776.
    *   Addition of `bandwidth-scientific-notation` typedef (from draft-ietf-yang-lpt-topp) for broader applicability (e.g., LSPs, tunnels, non-packet technology).
    *   Addition of `encoding-and-switching-type` grouping (from packet-computation draft) for broader applicability and model alignment.
    *   The proposed process is an update document containing only the changed `te-types` module, not a full `bis` document, with comments for the RFC editor on changes.
*   **Solution for Network Slices in Packet Networks:**
    *   Draft revision 08 received detailed review comments during the working group adoption poll.
    *   Some comments related to individual solutions driven in other WGs will be removed to keep this document generic.
    *   The document status will be changed to Informational based on poll feedback.
*   **Service Delivery Model for Network Slicing:**
    *   Proposed augmentation to support Point-to-Multipoint (P2MP), Multipoint-to-Point (MP2P), and Multipoint-to-Multipoint (MP2MP) communication types using `replication-groups` and `receiver-constraint-group` YANG constructs.
    *   Discussion on the model's relationship to existing service models and the approach of augmentation versus referencing topology models. Concerns raised about potential naming confusion with existing NVI models.
*   **Use Cases and Attributes for NSI:**
    *   Documenting use cases for the Northbound Slice Interface (NSI), including 5G (public/private), NFV-based services, network sharing, SD-WAN, and O-RAN splits.
    *   Added content on private 5G networks and a summary of attributes and procedures (work in progress).
    *   Discussion on providing concrete feedback to the framework and YANG model documents based on the use case analysis.
*   **Scalability Considerations for NRP:**
    *   Draft renamed from "VTN scalability" to "NRP scalability" to align with IETF Network Slicing terminology.
    *   Provides scalability analysis and optimization suggestions for NRPs in both control and data planes.
*   **YANG Data Model for NRP Policies:**
    *   Defines a data model for provisioning and managing NRP policies, supporting three modes: control plane only partitioning, data plane partitioning, and both.
    *   Key elements include resource reservation, flow aggregate selectors (for data plane identification), per-hop behaviors (QoS policies), and topology filters.
    *   Clarification that the model covers bandwidth reservation, data plane selector, and control plane/topology.
*   **NRP YANG Module:**
    *   Presents an NRP model covering instantiation, monitoring, and modification.
    *   Distinguishes itself from the NRP Policy model by focusing on customized NRP topologies (derived from physical/filtered L3, TE, SR topologies) and monitoring capabilities.
    *   Discussion on whether "link-specific resources" are a property of slice realization or NRP resources.
*   **Instantiating IETF Network Slices in SP Networks:**
    *   Explores reusing existing IETF machinery (YANG models, architectures) to operate network slices and identifies potential gaps.
    *   Discussed architectural options and a preliminary mapping between the NSC NBI YANG model and the L3 Service Model, highlighting potential mismatches (e.g., packet error rate).
*   **Mapping 3GPP Network Slices to IETF Network Slices:**
    *   Investigates how 3GPP network slicing concepts, particularly Endpoint Transport (EP Transport) parameters, can be mapped to IETF network slices.
    *   A preliminary mapping exercise was presented, focusing on parameters like IP address, logical interface info, and QoS profile.
*   **Framework for End-to-End IETF Network Slicing:**
    *   Framework covers 5G end-to-end network slicing and inter-domain IETF network slicing.
    *   Aligned terminology to use NRP and discussed mapping 5G S-NSSAI to Global and Domain NRP IDs.
*   **Deployment Status and Considerations for IETF Network Slices:**
    *   Presented two real-world operator deployment cases using Network Slicing based on VPN+ technologies:
        1.  **Multi-Industrial Networks (China Telecom):** SRv6-based network using virtual sub-interfaces and SRv6 SIDs, IS-IS policies with link affinity. Observations: Any-to-Any connections require large policy provisioning, considering optimized SRv6 best-effort slicing, data plane VTN/resource ID for scalability, and hierarchical slicing for future per-customer needs.
        2.  **Fixed Mobile Convergence (FMC) Network:** SR-MPLS (SR-ISIS) based for mobile, enterprise, and broadband services, using Flexible Ethernet and virtual sub-interfaces. Observations: Automation is crucial, considering high-scalability slicing solutions and slice ID mechanisms.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Updates to Common TE Types:** The proposed process of an update document containing *only the changed te-types module* of RFC 8776 was generally accepted, with the full model to be included and changes noted for the RFC editor.
*   **Solution for Network Slices in Packet Networks:**
    *   **Decision:** Change document status to Informational (based on adoption poll feedback).
    *   **Action Item:** Authors to issue revision 09 addressing immediate concerns and adding a new section for open issues.
    *   **Action Item:** If no further concerns, republish as a `00-wg-document`.
*   **Use Cases and Attributes for NSI:**
    *   **Action Item:** More discussion on the mailing list is needed regarding WG adoption, particularly any objections.
*   **Scalability Considerations for NRP:**
    *   **Action Item:** More discussion on the mailing list is needed before polling for WG adoption.
