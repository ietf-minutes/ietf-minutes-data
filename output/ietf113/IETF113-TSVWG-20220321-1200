# tsvwg

## Summary

The tsvwg session covered several key documents and administrative updates. Discussions focused on the long-standing SCTP NAT draft, potential ways forward for DTLS over SCTP in light of IPR concerns and updates to RFC 6083, and the status and future of the L4S Operational Guidance draft. While no firm technical decisions were made during the session for the main drafts, chairs committed to soliciting further input on the mailing list to determine paths forward.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Administrative Updates**
    *   Stewart Cheshire volunteered as note-taker.
    *   Attendees were reminded to scan the QR code for blue sheets and use the Meetecho queue for comments.
    *   Importance of document reviews was highlighted, specifically for UDP Options and DSCP Considerations drafts.
    *   **RFCs and Draft Status**:
        *   No RFCs published since IETF 112.
        *   One ID at RFC Editor (496 obis).
        *   Five IDs with working group chairs/authors, progressing to AD.
        *   ECN NULs and ECN for tunnels: Text refinement pending, no further WG input anticipated, changes to be sent to list for confirmation.
        *   Three L4S IDs: Post-WGLC, close to AD submission after addressing comments and shepherd write-ups (Wes will manage).
        *   Remaining WGLC items: L4S Ops Guidance, NQB, UDP Options, DPLPMTUD for UDP Options, DTLS/SCTP, SCTP NAT, DSCP, MPDCCP (some to be discussed Friday).
        *   Milestones are being refreshed and kept sensible as useful targets.
    *   **Liaisons and Announcements**:
        *   WBA liaison (DSCP usage coordination): No updates since response a year ago, likely to be removed from future agendas.
        *   DTLS liaison (encouragement to publish for 3GPP reference): No new updates.
        *   GSMA liaison (MPDCCP expectations): Discussed previously, no new updates.
    *   **New Work Coordination**:
        *   **DCCP CCID for BBR**: Proposed new CCID for DCCP related to BBR. TSVWG will await BBR algorithm approval in ICCRG before determining if a CCID is appropriate.
        *   **HPCC++**: Agenda slot in RTGWG; noted as having routing relationship but potentially belonging in Transport/ICCRG for data center congestion control.

*   **SCTP NAT Draft (draft-ietf-tsvwg-sctp-nat)**
    *   **Problem Statement**: SCTP multi-homing allows multiple IP addresses but only a single port, leading to port number collisions in NAT environments. UDP/TCP NATs remap ports, but SCTP cannot easily do this without consistent mapping across all paths. The draft proposes using the verification tag as a connection identifier to handle collisions.
    *   **AD Comments/Issues Raised**:
        *   IP fragmentation handling.
        *   Controlling NAT-friendly behavior (socket option vs. private address detection).
        *   Improved multi-homing support (more examples, multiple external addresses).
        *   Re-include remote address in NAT binding table (was removed for simplification based on research).
        *   Simplify SCTP packet processing at NAT (avoid parsing chunk types).
        *   Clarify when NAT state is added and if NAT should send packets.
        *   Address SCTP association notion to support multiple associations with same port using verification tag.
    *   **Proposed Ways Forward**:
        1.  **Stick with current method**: Address issues 2-5 (fragmentation is wording), adds complexity.
        2.  **Fallback to SCTP-unaware NAT**: Remove SCTP-specific features (no verification tag, no restart disable), add external remote addresses to binding table. Drawback: Cannot resolve local port collisions, association establishment can fail. Does not change endpoint association definition. (Michael's preferred option)
        3.  **Drop document and use Ericsson proposal**: Ericsson has an alternative proposal. (Claudio is prototyping this option).
        4.  **Drop work entirely**: If the outcome is an "almost SCTP-unaware NAT," it might not require SCTP-specific work.
    *   **Discussion**:
        *   Claudio noted a growing need for SCTP NAT in cloud environments with virtual machines.
        *   Martin Duke (AD hat off) asked Michael's preferred option; Michael favored option 2 for addressing more issues.
        *   Claudio mentioned prototyping option 3 (Ericsson proposal) in open source (Linux, FreeBSD user space SCTP) and will share results.
        *   Magnus suggested considering trade-offs between multi-homing support, number of concurrent sessions, and solution complexity.
        *   Colin Jenkins expressed concerns about option 2's viability, citing UDP NAT issues with 1:1 mappings and DDoS risks, questioning how conflicts would be resolved without dropping packets. Michael clarified that the NAT box would notify the internal host of port collision.
    *   **Outcome**: No immediate decision. Chairs will follow up on the mailing list to gather consensus on a path forward.

*   **DTLS over SCTP (draft-ietf-tsvwg-dtls-over-sctp)**
    *   **Problem Statement**: Addressing user message limits in RFC 6083 and 3GPP requirements for various RAT protocols.
    *   **Recent Updates**: Significant clarifications, especially around message length limitations (up to 2^64-1 bytes), stream usage, shutdown procedures, and SCTP API considerations.
    *   **Differences from RFC 6083**:
        *   Addresses message length.
        *   SCTP association handshake negotiates DTLS over SCTP support.
        *   Minimizes impact on ULP protocols, wider feature support.
        *   RFC 6083's limitations with DTLS 1.2/1.3 (e.g., renegotiation security issues, key update limits, session length limits).
        *   SCTP Auth (HMAC-SHA1 aging) considerations.
    *   **Proposed Ways Forward**:
        1.  Obsolete RFC 6083. (Default, but IPR issues).
        2.  Publish as an alternative RFC to 6083 (without obsoleting). (Magnus's preferred option).
    *   **Discussion**:
        *   Michael expressed concerns about obsoleting RFC 6083 (an open-source implementable standard) with a document backed by company IPR, making open-source implementations difficult. Suggested working on an update to RFC 6083 if community interest.
        *   Magnus stressed the need for progress for 3GPP and that having no progress is not productive.
        *   Martin Duke (AD) acknowledged the IPR problem for BSD implementations. Noted lack of energy for an IPR-free version of RFC 6083. It seems inevitable there will be parallel specifications. Also noted RFC 6083 may need maintenance for security reasons anyway.
        *   Magnus clarified interoperability: The new draft clearly defines negotiation in the association handshake, distinct from RFC 6083's detection via SCTP Auth and DTLS handshake. Defined fallback mechanism prevents misinterpretation.
    *   **Outcome**: No immediate decision. Chairs will work with speakers to formulate a proposal for the mailing list to decide between obsoleting RFC 6083 or publishing the new draft as an alternative, considering the IPR implications.

*   **L4S Operational Guidance (draft-ietf-tsvwg-l4s-ops)**
    *   **Status**: One To-Do item remaining. Draft is stable, primarily typo fixes since last IETF. New contributions would be accepted.
    *   **Question**: Should the document remain a draft during the l4s experiment, or should it be finished and published as an RFC?
    *   **Discussion**:
        *   David Black suggested publishing it as an RFC soon (possibly with other L4S drafts) and immediately opening a `bis` draft to capture lessons learned during the experiment. He argued that the draft is stable, and broader dissemination would be beneficial.
        *   Martin Duke noted that "during the L4S experiment" could mean years due to slow deployment and operational experience. He leaned towards David's solution of publishing now and a `bis` later.
        *   Mirja K. provided a quick plus one to publish now.
    *   **Outcome**: No immediate decision. Chairs will seek further feedback on the mailing list regarding whether to publish as an RFC now and create a `bis` draft later, or to keep it as an evolving draft during the anticipated long L4S experiment phase.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Decision**: Stewart Cheshire volunteered to be the note-taker for this session.

*   **Action Item**: Chairs to post to the mailing list to solicit further input regarding the L4S Ops Guidance draft: whether to publish it as an RFC now and open a `bis` draft, or keep it as a draft during the L4S experiment.
*   **Action Item**: Wes to finalize the shepherd write-ups for the three L4S IDs and submit them to the Area Director within approximately one week.
*   **Action Item**: Chairs to continue reviewing and updating working group milestones to ensure they remain relevant.
*   **Action Item**: Chairs to send announcements to the mailing list with details about the ATSS side meeting following the Friday session.
