# pce

## Summary
The PCE working group session covered the status of existing documents, including several approaching Working Group Last Call (WGLC) or awaiting AD review. Key discussions revolved around the specifics of new proposals: PCE extensions for Circuit Style SR Policies, PCE Extensions to Redundancy Policy, and PCE Extensions for SID Verification for SR Policies. The working group addressed open technical issues, clarified use cases, and emphasized the need for better cross-document coordination and continued mailing list discussions.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Working Group Document Status:**
    *   One document is in the RFC Editor queue, awaiting a reference to another document.
    *   Three documents are with the ADs for publication: "extended flags" and "stateful GMPLS extensions".
    *   Several IPR disclosures were announced, including one for the Flow Spec RFC, one for a multipath draft, and one for IFIT. Discussion on the mailing list is encouraged.
    *   Four documents have received IANA early allocation code points. Chairs will assist authors in triggering the early allocation policy if needed for new specifications.

*   **Individual Document Updates & Discussions:**
    *   **Local Protection Enforcement (draft-ietf-pce-local-protection-enforcement):** WGLC completed. Currently awaiting Shepherd review (Julian). Updates addressed Yang Doctor review comments, including moving repetitive content to an appendix, clarifying relationship with PSEPMIP, renaming leaves, collapsing single-use groupings, adding stateful GMPLS capability to the Yang model, and validating examples. Considered ready for WGLC.
    *   **SRv6 (draft-ietf-pce-srv6-inst-info):** Received two updates, including an IANA allocation and enhanced security considerations. Mostly editorial changes. Recommended for prioritization for WGLC.
    *   **Native IP and Flex Grid (draft-ietf-pce-native-ip-only, draft-ietf-pce-flex-grid):** No recent updates. Working group members are encouraged to review these documents.
    *   **Enhanced Errors (draft-ietf-pce-enhanced-errors):** No progress or feedback received. The working group needs to decide on the future of this document.
    *   **Path Segment (draft-ietf-pce-path-segment):** No change. An open issue was highlighted regarding the two mechanisms for path segment allocation (via TLV or PCC mechanism). The chairs sought working group consensus on supporting both or focusing on a single one. Authors confirmed current intent to support both, open to mailing list discussion.
    *   **Bi-directional SR Path (draft-ietf-pce-bidirectional-sr-paths):** No change, considered ready for WGLC. Authors confirmed readiness for WGLC.
    *   **SR Policy (draft-ietf-pce-sr-policy):** An update added an invalidation TLV for traffic steering (for down/invalid LSPs).
    *   **PCC SR (draft-ietf-pce-pcc-sr):** An update added text for anycast SID allocation.
    *   **Multipath (draft-ietf-pce-multipath):** Multiple updates, including multipath opposite direction path TLV, an implementation status section (listing three existing implementations), and early IANA allocation.
    *   **State Sync between PCEs (draft-ietf-pce-state-sync):** Two updates, adding implementation status and manageability considerations. An open issue is how primary/secondary PCE selection priority is advertised, as it's currently out of scope (assumed via configuration/Yang or future capability). Feedback from the working group is requested.
    *   **Optional (draft-ietf-pce-optional-processing):** Implementation status added, but no known implementations listed. Implementers were urged to reach out to chairs/authors.
    *   **Algorithm SID Algo (draft-ietf-pce-algorithm-sid-algo):** Adopted in February, but comments received during adoption are still pending. Authors noted conflicting opinions and plan partial updates, with a suggestion to use editor's notes for disagreements.
    *   **Path MTU (draft-ietf-pce-sr-path-mtu):** A companion document in Spring has been produced and presented. Text has moved from the PCE document to the Spring document. Updates included clarifying RFC 5440 for metric bounds (min vs. max for MTU) and adding a multipath section.

*   **PCE Extensions for Circuit Style SR Policies (draft-ietf-pce-cs-sr-policy-ext-01):**
    *   **Purpose:** Extends PCE to meet requirements for connection-oriented transport services using SR policies (circuit style SR policies), focusing on path persistency and by-hop behavior (adj-SIDs/prefix-SIDs).
    *   **Changes:** Simplified a new TLV for blocking path computation/optimization (removed flags, renamed, moved from LSP to LSPA object, though a recent comment suggests moving it back). Introduced new flags for allowing/blocking path modification (if original path invalid) and for explicit operator requests. Generalized the state path definition.
    *   **Discussion:**
        *   **Delegation without Re-computation:** A primary point of discussion was the use case for delegating a path to the PCE but restricting its re-optimization capabilities. Examples provided included maintaining established resource usage and controlled teardowns based on bandwidth awareness by the PCE. Clarifying text for this scenario will be added to the document.
        *   **Spring vs. PCE Document Content:** A suggestion was made to keep the Spring document for circuit-style SR policies as general as possible, moving PCE-specific text and mechanisms (like delegation) to the PCE document. This would allow the Spring document to be technology-agnostic.
        *   **Policy Framework:** A broader discussion point raised whether "circuit style" policies should be handled as a specific, new flag/TLV or integrated into a more general "well-known path profile" or policy framework. Authors stated the flags are designed to be reusable beyond just circuit style policies.

*   **PCE Extensions to Redundancy Policy (draft-li-pce-redundancy-policy-extension-00):**
    *   **Purpose:** Introduces PCE extensions for a generalized redundancy protection mechanism (packet replication, multiple disjoint paths, first-accurate merging). This builds on related drafts defining redundancy SIDs, SR policies, and BGP extensions.
    *   **Proposed Extensions:** New TLVs in the Request Parameters Object to request redundancy path computation and protection method. Also, a TLV to distribute a new redundancy flag attribute for candidate paths within the SR Policy Association Group.
    *   **Discussion:**
        *   **SR-MPLS Coverage:** Concern was raised that the existing Spring redundancy protection document is SRv6-specific. The authors confirmed the intent to support both SR-MPLS and SRv6, acknowledging a gap for SR-MPLS data plane specifications that needs addressing.
        *   **Coordination with Thatnet:** A suggestion was made to coordinate with the Thatnet working group, as redundancy functions originate from their work.
        *   **Protection Type Definition:** Further clarification is needed on how this "redundancy protection" differs from existing PCE protection mechanisms (e.g., diversity) and how they would interact if both are encoded. Discussion is needed on whether a new T-S-A is necessary or if existing mechanisms can be extended.

*   **PCE Extensions for SID Verification for SR Policies (draft-ietf-pce-sr-state-verification-01):**
    *   **Purpose:** Defines a mechanism for a PCC to explicitly request the PCE to verify a Segment ID (SID) state.
    *   **Mechanism:** Introduces a new 'V' flag in the SR ERO sub-object for indicating the explicit verification request. An SRRO sub-object for reporting verification failures is also defined.
    *   **Status:** Updates have been made based on AD comments. The document is considered ready for a call for adoption. It received support for adoption from a working group member.

*   **Cross-Document Coordination:** A new wiki page was introduced to help track dependencies and coordinate work across multiple working groups (PCE, Spring, BGP, I2RS) to prevent issues like missed bit flags or inconsistent definitions. Authors are encouraged to update this wiki.
