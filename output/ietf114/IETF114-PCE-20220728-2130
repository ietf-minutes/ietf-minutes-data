## Summary

The pce working group session covered several key areas: clarifications for the PCEP protocol, an update on PCEP extensions for In-situ Flow Information Telemetry (IFIT), two early-stage proposals for PCEP extensions to support Deterministic Networking (DetNet) bounded latency, and a proposal for PCEP extensions for Network Resource Partition (NRP) ID. Discussions included the structuring of clarification documents, alignment with other working groups' efforts (DetNet, ICN, IETF-NS), and coordination between similar PCEP extension drafts.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **PCEP Operational Clarifications (draft-ietf-pce-pcep-operational-clarifications)**
    *   **Optional PCReq/PCReply:** Proposed making PCRequest and PCReply messages optional to reduce signaling (from three messages to one for tunnel setup), reflecting current vendor practices.
    *   **Terminology:** Clarified "PCEP tunnel" (identified by PSPID symbolic name) versus "PCEP LSP" (an instance of a tunnel for make-before-break, identified by LSP identifiers TLV).
    *   **Associations:** Clarified that PCEP associations contain LSPs, not tunnels.
    *   **LSP Operations:** Provided examples of various LSP operations to address observed interop issues.
    *   **Object Absence:** Explicitly stated that the absence of an object (if it lacks an explicit removal flag) implies the removal of the constraint it represents.
    *   **SR RRO Discouragement:** Discouraged the use of SR RRO due to its RCPT concept origin and confusion it caused with SR paths.
    *   **Draft Structure Discussion:** Raised the question of whether to keep informative and normative content in a single draft (clearly separated) or split into two separate drafts.
        *   **Andrew Stone, Adrian Farrell:** Expressed a mild preference for a single draft, clearly distinguishing informative/normative sections.
        *   **Dhruv Dhody:** Preferred two separate drafts for clarity, noting the difficulty in separating content within a single document for reviewers. Suggested making normative changes explicit upfront, followed by examples.
        *   **Julian Lucek:** Suggested taking the discussion on draft structure to the mailing list to reach consensus between options 1 (single draft with clear separation) and 2 (two separate drafts).

*   **PCEP Extension for IFIT (draft-ietf-pce-pcep-ifit)**
    *   **Draft Status:** The draft was recently adopted by the working group.
    *   **IFIT Scope:** The extensions define IFIT capabilities and attributes as TLVs within the LSP Attributes (LSPA) object, applicable to various path types (not just SR).
    *   **Capabilities:** An IFIT Capability TLV (optional) in the OPEN object advertises support for ION (in-situ OAM) and Alternate Marking via five flags.
    *   **Attributes:** An IFIT Attribute TLV provides configurable knobs (five sub-objects for ION/Alternate Marking) carried in the LSPA object.
    *   **Addressing Comments:** Upcoming `01` version will address comments including:
        *   Clarification on head-end support for IFIT capability (at least two nodes required).
        *   IPv6 examples for extension headers.
        *   Relationship between PCEP and BGP-SR Policy IFIT mechanisms.
        *   Clarification of IFIT terminology and framework.
        *   Editorial comments.
    *   **Adrian Farrell:** Questioned the lack of reference to the IFIT framework draft from the ops area, which stalled.
    *   **Dhruv Dhody:** Suggested clarifying the IFIT term (by reference or description) and tracking the scope for SR-MPLS, as discussions are ongoing in the MPLS WG. Emphasized coordination with related IDR drafts.

*   **PCEP Extension for DetNet Bounded Latency (draft-tran-pce-pcep-detnet-bonded-latency)**
    *   **Motivation:** To support DetNet requirements for bounded latency (min/max end-to-end latency, jitter) in path selection and establishment, considering queuing delay bounds.
    *   **Proposed Extensions:**
        *   Two new metrics in the Metric object: End-to-end Bounded Latency and End-to-end Bounded Jitter.
        *   A 'D' bit in the LSP Extended Flag TLV.
        *   Extension of queue information structure (possibly new sub-objects) in ERO/SERO/SRv6ERO.
    *   **Discussion:**
        *   **Janusz Wojcik:** Noted that the proposal is ahead of the DetNet WG's consensus on requirements and solutions. Suggested leveraging existing flow information RFCs and waiting for DetNet work to mature for queuing parts.
        *   **Andrew Stone:** Asked how PCEP learns processing delays; clarified by author that IGP advertisement for load delay would provide this. Suggested referencing such documents.
        *   **Greg Mirsky:** Encouraged informing or contributing to the DetNet controller plane framework document.
        *   **Dhruv Dhody:** Recommended clear references to DetNet requirements documents and consistent terminology.

*   **PCEP Extension for Enhanced DetNet (draft-shao-pce-pcep-enhanced-detnet)**
    *   **Motivation:** To transmit bounded latency information between PCC and PCE to guarantee bounded latency transmission in the control plane for Enhanced DetNet (RFC 8655, RFC 9440, SR Enhanced DetNet).
    *   **Proposed Extensions:**
        *   **OPEN Object:** Bounded Latency Capability TLV to negotiate feature support.
        *   **RP Object:** BR Type TLV to specify desired BR type/format.
        *   **PCRequest:** Traffic Model object to specify flow features for path computation.
        *   **PCReply:** BR Object (Bounded Latency Information) to indicate requirements and resource allocation. Two types: BRList TLV (different values per node) and Shared BR TLV (same value for all nodes).
        *   **SR Policy:** Extensions to carry BRList or Shared BR TLV.
    *   **Discussion:**
        *   **Dhruv Dhody:** Reiterated comments from the previous DetNet draft regarding clear requirements and terminology alignment, noting a potential mismatch in the current TLV structure (one BLI per hop vs. multiple BLIs needed per hop as mentioned in DetNet WG).

*   **PCEP Extension for NR-P ID (draft-shuaiwang-pce-pcep-nrpid)**
    *   **Motivation:** To support Network Resource Partition (NRP) ID as a constraint for network slicing during path computation, replacing earlier t-constraints drafts.
    *   **NRP ID Definition:** Defines NRP ID based on IETF-NS and IETF-MPLS-RP terminology, as a globally unique identifier within an RP domain.
    *   **Proposed Extensions:**
        *   NRP ID TLV to identify slices and network resources.
        *   Carried in PCReport, PCInitiate, and PCUpdate messages.
    *   **Next Steps:**
        *   Add NRP capability in OPEN message.
        *   Clarify path computation with NRP ID constraint.
        *   Add reference to IETF-NS NRP extensions.
    *   **Hongwei Li:** Noted a similar draft (`draft-ietf-pce-pcep-slicing`) exists. Emphasized coordination among control plane drafts (IGP, BGP, PCEP) for network slicing and aligning with IETF-NS WG terminology.
    *   **Shuaiwang Li:** Agreed to discuss and collaborate on unifying this work.
    *   **Dhruv Dhody:** Urged authors of similar drafts to work together for a single, unified document.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **`draft-ietf-pce-pcep-ifit`:** Adopted by the working group. Authors to publish a `01` version addressing comments.
*   **`draft-ietf-pce-pcep-operational-clarifications`:** Working Group adoption requested.
    *   **Action Item:** The chairs will initiate a discussion on the mailing list to achieve consensus on the draft's structure (single document with clear separation of informative/normative content vs. two separate documents).
*   **DetNet PCEP Extension Drafts:**
    *   **Action Item (Authors):** Align proposals with DetNet working group requirements and terminology. Reference relevant DetNet documents and the DetNet controller plane framework.
*   **NRP ID PCEP Extension Drafts:**
    *   **Action Item (Authors):** The authors of `draft-shuaiwang-pce-pcep-nrpid` and `draft-ietf-pce-pcep-slicing` (and potentially others) are urged to collaborate and consolidate their work into a single document for the working group.

*   Continue discussions on the pce mailing list for all drafts, especially regarding the structure of the `pcep-operational-clarifications` draft and the coordination of DetNet and NRP ID related work.
*   Authors of `draft-ietf-pce-pcep-ifit` to publish a new version addressing comments.
*   Authors of DetNet PCEP drafts to engage with the DetNet WG to ensure alignment.
