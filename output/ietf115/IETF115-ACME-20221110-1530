## Summary

The ACME working group meeting covered document status, including updates on several drafts, notably the Authority Token and TN Auth List, DTN Node ID, and Device Attestation drafts. A new challenge type, DNS Account 01, was presented. Discussions focused on coordinating attestation formats across working groups and addressing potential CAB Forum implications for the proposed DNS Account 01.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Authority Token and TN Auth List:** Authority Token is approved and will be in RFC TQS. TN Auth List has some outstanding issues but should be resolved by December.
*   **DTN Node ID:** Progress is blocked awaiting a DTN registry update. The ACME working group is comfortable with parking the document until the DTN dependency is resolved.
*   **Acme Integrations:** Revised AP needed.
*   **Device Attestation:** Coordination needed across ITF working groups (ACME, LAMPS) and external consortia on the attestation encapsulation format. There are implementations from Apple and Smallstep.
*   **DNS Account 01:** A new DNS challenge type was presented to address multi-region deployments and zero-downtime migrations. Further review is needed, particularly regarding potential CAB Forum baseline requirement issues.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Authority Token:** No action required.
*   **TN Auth List:**  Author team to finalize changes by December.
*   **DTN Node ID:**  Document will be parked with the AD until the DTN registry update progresses.
*   **Device Attestation:** A call for working group adoption will be sent to the mailing list. Need more review.
*   **DNS Account 01:** A call for working group adoption will be sent to the mailing list. Author team to investigate potential CAB Forum baseline requirement issues.

## Next Steps

*   Send adoption calls to the mailing list for the Device Attestation and DNS Account 01 drafts.
*   Authors of TN Auth List need to deliver final changes by December.
*   Track progress of the DTN registry update before moving forward with the DTN Node ID draft.
*   Encourage increased review of the Device Attestation draft on the mailing list.
*   Discuss potential CAB Forum implications for the DNS Account 01 draft on the mailing list.
