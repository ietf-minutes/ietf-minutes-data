# detnet

## Summary
This meeting covered several topics including updates on existing drafts, a liaison statement from 3GPP SA2, and presentations of new work, particularly focused on queuing mechanisms and large-scale deterministic networks. A key theme was the need for scalability and bounded latency in detnet deployments.

## Key Discussion Points
*   **Liaison Statement from 3GPP SA2:** Explored the integration of 3GPP networks within the detnet architecture. Questions were raised regarding node requirements and the information 3GPP can expose to detnet controllers.  Need to provide written liaison response.
*   **MPLS OEM Updates:** Discussion focused on extensions to the Associated Channel Header (ACH) for detnet, including sequence numbering, node ID, level flags, and session identifier.  Waiting on feedback from commenters on the WG Last Call.
*   **Detnet Controller Plane Framework Updates:** Proposals included detailed descriptions of detnet mechanisms, resource collection, path computation/allocation/establishment, and the relationship between the control and management planes. Integration of Carlos's multi-domain text is still needed.
*   **MPLS Over IP RIO Function Draft:**  Leverages mpls over UDP tunnels for RIO. Goal is working group last call.
*   **Packet Ordering Function Draft:** Focuses on packet reordering algorithms for networks using replication and elimination. Goal is working group last call.
*   **Large Scale Detnet Requirements Draft:** Addresses relaxed clock synchronization, long-distance hops, diverse transmission rates, and a large number of flows.  Merge with solution draft is planned.
*   **Detnet Enhancement for Large Scale Deterministic Networks:** Presents gap analysis and proposed enhancements for functions, metadata treatment, and encapsulation for large-scale detnet.
*   **Detnet Token Framework Updates:**  Introduced global finish time-based forwarding framework with metadata for latency guarantees.
*   **Detnet Tagged Cyclic Queuing and Forwarding:** Addresses scalability issues with large detnets. Explores the use of DSCP for cycle identification, allowing IP and MPLS to be supported without extension headers.
*   **Bounded Latency Information Encapsulation Draft:** Proposes new data-specific metadata to facilitate detnet translator nodes to guarantee bounded latency.
*   **Deadline Aware Scheme for Detnet IETF Draft:** Introduces Dynamic EDF force scheduling to dynamically rotate the priority of each aggregated flow and uniformly provide bounded delay data.
*   **MPLS Substack Encapsulation for Detnet with DRA:** Addresses traffic congestion, data reduction, and service protection. Introduces the terms Deterministic Latency and Deterministic Latency Action.
*   **YANG Data Model for Detnet Based Network Slice:** Explores the application of network slicing to detnet.

## Decisions and Action Items
*   **Action Item:** Develop a draft response to the 3GPP SA2 liaison statement. (Owner: Detnet WG)
*   **Action Item:** Greg to follow up with Pascal regarding comments on the IP OEM draft.
*   **Action Item:** Incorporate text from Carlos related to multi-domain into the Controller Plane Framework draft.
*   **Action Item:** Merge the Large Scale Detnet Requirements draft with the Detnet Enhancement for Large Scale Deterministic Networks draft.
*   **Action Item:** Lee Zhang to consider separating the bounded latency information draft into requirements and solutions documents.

## Next Steps
*   Continue discussion on the mailing list.
*   Consider scheduling an interim meeting focused on queuing mechanisms due to the high level of interest.
*   Coordinate with the TEAS working group to align terminology and work related to network slicing.
