# httpbis

## Summary

This httpbis meeting covered several topics, including HTTP message signatures, alternative services, origin H3, cookies and partitioned cookies, client certificates, and a status update from the MASK working group. Discussions focused on open issues, design considerations, and potential future directions for each topic.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **HTTP Message Signatures:** Discussion centered on handling trailers in HTTP message signatures, specifically whether to treat header and trailer fields as distinct namespaces and the implications for signing trailers. Justin Richer will add a PR to include a trailer flag.
*   **Alternative Services:** Mike Bishop presented on alt service B, an alternative to the existing alt service mechanism. Discussion focused on stickiness, DNS integration, and whether alt service B should completely replace old service. The discussion points to a general interest in https records and having some control over the use of an alternative.
*   **Origin H3:** The main topic was handling flags in the origin frame for H3, given that H3 does not have flags in the same way as H2. Participants leaned towards deprecating flag usage.
*   **Cookies:** Stephen Bingler provided a status update on RFC 6265bis, including the case-insensitive handling of cookie prefixes and open issues related to same-site cookies, internal whitespace, and clearer implementation guidance.
*   **Partitioned Cookies:** Dylan Cutler presented on partitioned cookies (CHIPS), a proposal for a new cookie attribute that would limit third-party cookies to the top-level site where they were created. The discussion covered handling partitioned cookies in unpartitioned contexts, the use of a cross-site ancestor bit, and handling cookies with the same name but different partition attributes.
*   **Client Certificates:** Mark Nottingham shared an update on Client Certificates, emphasizing open issues from Lucas Conley and that the group is nearing working group last call.
*   **MASK:** David Schinazi provided an overview of the MASK (Multiplexed Application Substrate over QUIC Encryption) working group, its goals, current status, and potential future directions, including extensions for CONNECT UDP and HTTP datagrams. The discussions highlighted the goal of creating a VPN that looks like regular web traffic.
*    **Unprompted Authentication:** David Schinazi introduced a draft on unprompted authentication using TLS key exporters.  Ben Schwartz had concerns regarding the need for the design and potential alternatives. There was some interest to explore the design in the group.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **HTTP Message Signatures:** Justin Richer will submit a PR to add a TR flag to define trailer data sources.
*   **Origin H3:** Close the issue with no action and Kick the Can down the road
*   **Alternative Services:** Continue discussion on the alt service B draft and leave the old service best document parked.
*   **Cookies:** Close three open issues in 6265bis, go through working group last call and then start almost an immediate revision.
*   **Partitioned Cookies:** Align with spec work at the W3C.
*   **Client Certificates:** Continue working group last call, address open issues.
*   **Unprompted Authentication:** Explore issues and use cases, why the current solution is appropriate.

## Next Steps

*   Continue discussions on the mailing lists for all topics.
*   Authors to address action items and open issues.
*   Consider a call for adoption for alt service B after further discussion.
*   Potential re-chartering of the MASK working group for future extensions.
