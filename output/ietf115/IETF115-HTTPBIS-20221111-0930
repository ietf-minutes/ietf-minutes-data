## Summary

This was a full session covering several topics, including resumable uploads, retrofit structured fields, query, origin deployment, modern HTTP proxies, and HTTP authentication with SASL.  Key discussions revolved around technical design choices, potential dependencies, and implementation considerations.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Resumable Uploads:**
    *   Server-generated URLs vs. client-generated tokens for identifying uploads.  The group showed a preference for server-generated URLs.
    *   Use of item potency keys for the upload creation procedure, including potential collisions. Concerns were raised.
    *   Identifying the upload creation procedure, specifically the use of the "Prefer" header. Alternative solutions using a new custom header were also proposed.
    *   Interaction between "Expect: 100-continue" and informational responses.
    *   The need for including hashes to validate the integrity of the uploaded file.
*   **Retrofit Structured Fields:**
    *   Location of compatibility modifications (specifically whitespace handling) - whether to include in structured fields spec or keep only in retrofit document. General agreement to include in structured fields spec with a compatibility flag.
    *   Differences in error handling compared to HTTP parsing.
    *   Adding mapped fields for Authorization and WWW-Authenticate.
*   **Query:**
    *   Editorial improvements needed around documentation and motivation.
    *   Defining semantics for form-based media types in relation to query.
    *   Addressing redirections, conditional queries, and caching.
*   **Origin Deployment:**
    *   The effect of congestion control window on the transfer of sub-resources.
    *   Breakdown of different protocols and their potential impact on performance.
    *   Consideration of the cache's effect (cold vs. warm) on performance.
*   **Modern HTTP Proxies:**
    *   Splitting the TCP connect and request proxying aspects of the draft. There was more support for the TCP connect proposal.
    *   Charter scope and potentially moving the TCP connect portion to the mask working group.
    *   Whether using this is enough of a good idea for all the Legacy proxy implementations to rewrite it onto this new way of doing things.
*   **HTTP Authentication with SASL:**
    *   Concerns over whether Sasol is a security protocol and should be in the security area.
    *   Integrating with browser APIs. If it is possible to do in a self-service fashion then that gives you an opportunity to demonstrate a utility without necessarily requiring everyone in the in the ecosystem to implement something.
    *   Applicability to client libraries like Curl.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Resumable Uploads:** The draft will be updated to reflect the preference for server-generated URLs.
*   **Retrofit Structured Fields:** The draft will be updated to incorporate compatibility modifications into structured fields spec using a flag.
*   **Modern HTTP Proxies:** Ben will create a new document that is smaller and more focused on TCP connect. They will be split out and the message proxying will be separated. The TCP connect document will be taken to the list.
*   **HTTP Authentication with SASL:** Chairs to discuss next steps.

## Next Steps

*   Authors to update drafts based on meeting feedback.
*   Continue discussion on the mailing lists, especially for adopted drafts.
*   Chair to follow up on action items and decide future steps for HTTP Authentication with SASL.
