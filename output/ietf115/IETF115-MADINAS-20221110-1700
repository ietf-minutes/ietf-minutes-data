## Summary

The meeting covered updates on the working group status, problem statement, MAC address randomization document, open discussion on the BCP, an update on the open roaming experiment, and next steps. Discussions focused on refining use cases and requirements for RCM, existing and future solutions, and potential issues.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Use Cases and Requirements Document:**
    *   Carlos suggested renaming the document to reflect both "Use Cases and Requirements" if requirements are kept.
    *   Carlos proposed restructuring the document to explicitly list use cases (e.g., use case A, B, C).
    *   It was suggested that existing content should be restructured into use cases, addressing different environments.
*   **BCP Document:**
    *   Discussion regarding the structure of the BCP and whether it should address use cases, requirements or scenarios.
    *   It was suggested that the BCP structure should follow a logical sequence: use cases, requirements for each use case, existing solutions, and best common practices.
    *   A need to identify existing solutions and determine whether they address all use cases and requirements was expressed.
    *   Michael suggested the BCP should include "don'ts" as well as "do's," identifying practices that do not work. He mentioned avoiding WPA PSK and unencrypted hotel networks.
*   **MAC Address Randomization Document:**
    *   Carlos presented changes to the document, including a taxonomy of MAC address randomization policies.
    *   Michael proposed documenting "stupid" policies to facilitate discussions about bad ideas.
    *   Discussions regarding the "per connection" generated MAC address policy and the combination of policies used by mobile OS vendors.
    *   Eric requested a change in the document title to use "randomize" instead of "randomization" for consistency.
    *   The need to reflect all the various flavors of MAC address randomization that happen in practice, even bad ones.
*   **Open Roaming Experiment:**
    *   The open roaming experiment in London was not possible due to multiple factors but remains on the table for future meetings.
    *   An update was given on the technical meeting between the WBA and the IETF NOC regarding the experiment.
*   **Requirements formulation**
    *   Section 6.3 is not considered as useful for the current document and it's proposed to remove it.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Action Item:** Jerome to consider renaming the Use Cases document.
*   **Action Item:** Jerome to work on restructure the Use Cases document to explicitly list use cases.
*   **Action Item:** Carlos to add the "per connection" generated MAC address policy or a combined policy to the MAC address randomization document.
*   **Action Item:** Carlos to change the document title to use "randomize" instead of "randomization" for consistency.
*   **Action Item:** Carlos to include more detail about the different randomization policies happening in practice.
*   **Action Item:** Michael to work on the BCP document, with others providing guidance.
*   **Action Item:** Authors of the two documents to incorporate feedback from the meeting.
*   **Action Item:** Working group members to review the next iteration of the documents and provide feedback.
*   **Decision:** To consider running the Open Roaming experiment at Yokohama or San Francisco.
*   **Decision:** Remove Section 6.3 from the Use Cases document.
*   **Decision:** Move Section 7 (Solutions) from the Use Cases document to an Annex or a separate BCP document.

## Next Steps

*   Update the two existing documents based on the feedback received.
*   Solicit volunteers to review the next iteration of the documents.
*   Potentially prepare a skeleton BCP document.
*   Continue discussions with the WBA regarding the open roaming experiment for Yokohama or San Francisco.
