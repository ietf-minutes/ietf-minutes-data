## Summary

This meeting covered several topics, including working group document status, a Wiki migration update, an update on the MSD YANG draft, a presentation on using LSP Ping to bootstrap STAMP, and a draft on LSP trace route for IOM capability discovery. Key discussions involved the MSD YANG model's relationship to SRv6, the adoption status of the STAMP draft, and the timing of IOM capability discovery in the context of LSP establishment.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **RFC 8960 Errata:** An errata has been reported against RFC 8960. The co-authors acknowledge the issue and will work with the AD to resolve it. There appears to be a duplicate errata that will also be addressed.
*   **Wiki Migration:** The old IETF Wiki will be turned off in November after IETF 115. Content needs to be migrated to the new Wiki. Volunteers are needed to assist with this task.
*   **MSD YANG Draft:** The MSD YANG draft has been adopted as a working group document. The authors plan to request a YANG Doctor and Routing Directorate review, followed by a working group last call. A key discussion point was the interaction between the MSD YANG model and SRv6, specifically concerning the MSD type number space. The question was raised whether to split the MSD types into separate models for mpls and srv6. It was suggested to take this discussion to the mailing list.
*   **STAMP and LSP Ping:** Greg presented a draft on using LSP Ping to bootstrap STAMP sessions. The use of LSP Ping for session maintenance was discussed, as well as the advantages over existing solutions like RFC 7876. Laura voiced her support for adoption of the document. The need to clearly articulate the handling of reflector state (stateful vs. stateless) was also discussed.
*   **IOM Capability Discovery:** Xiaomi presented a draft on using LSP trace route to discover IOM capabilities. Tariq pointed out that the current approach requires the LSP to be established *before* capabilities can be discovered, a possible shortcoming. He suggested considering igp capability advertisement as an alternative.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **RFC 8960 Errata:** AD will be contacted.
*   **Wiki Migration:** Working group members to volunteer to help migrate content to the new Wiki.
*   **MSD YANG Draft:**  Authors to consider the relationship with SRv6 and whether a split of the YANG model is needed. Address the need of using an IANA module to document the MSD types.
*   **STAMP and LSP Ping:** Laura to review the draft and start the adoption process. Authors to clarify the text on how LSP Ping should be used and the handling of the reflector state (stateful vs. stateless).
*   **IOM Capability Discovery:** Authors to compare the described method with igp capability advertisement and report back to the working group.

## Next Steps

*   The MPLS working group will resume with a joint session tomorrow at 9:30.
