## Summary
The Routing Working Group (rtgwg) meeting featured a series of presentations on topics ranging from network configuration management using machine learning, routing on service addresses, scalable ID-based routing architecture, faster failure detection in IP networks, service deployment using SRv6, and network computing operation. The discussions covered technical aspects, potential challenges, and future directions of each presented work.

## Key Discussion Points
*   **Self-Defined Network Assimilation (SNA):**
    *   Automating the process of introducing heterogeneous network devices into a centralized Software-Defined Network (SDN).
    *   Using machine learning to understand network configuration menus and infer mappings between vendor device models and a unified model.
    *   Addressing challenges of menu formal heterogeneity, errors, and ambiguities in menus, and bridging the heterogeneity between configuration models.
    *   Alternative approach of using YANG models for configuration consistency.
*   **Routing on Service Addresses:**
    *   Transitioning from locator-based addressing to an addressing scheme that represents services.
    *   Replacing DNS resolution with on-path discovery using a shim overlay.
    *   Use cases included CDN interconnect, subscriber distribution, and multi-homed/multi-domain services.
    *   Utilizing service announcements with traffic steering constraints.
*   **Scalable ID-Based Routing Architecture (Kira):**
    *   Providing self-organized, robust control plane connectivity for large-scale networks.
    *   Using an ID-based routing protocol with source routing on top of any link layer.
    *   Employing a path ID-based forwarding tier to eliminate source routing overhead.
    *   Implementation and simulation results in topologies up to 200,000 nodes.
*   **Faster Failure Detection in IP Networks:**
    *   Accelerating failure detection for high-performance applications such as IP-based NVMe and cloud computing.
    *   Leveraging network devices to detect link or network failures and synchronize failure information.
    *   Notifying local access endpoints through subscription-based mechanisms.
    *   Discussion on potential performance bottlenecks and the potential for denial of service attacks.
*   **SRv6 for Service Deployment:**
    *   Presenting service deployment using SRv6 (Segment Routing IPv6) policy and its controller in a backbone network.
    *   A use case example using an Agricultural Bank in China.
    *   Discussed limitations, where all presented features can potentially be implemented with other technologies that are already available.
*   **SRv6 Intelligent Steering:**
    *   Proposing grouping of SR policies to enhance traffic management during failures.
    *   Introducing an intelligent steering unit to dynamically switch traffic between policy groups based on network conditions.
*   **Network Computing Operation:**
    *   Offloading compute tasks to network devices (programmable switches) for improved system performance.
    *   Using a generic sync header to specify data aggregation operations and routing to appropriate processing locations.
    *   Utilizing service function chaining (SFC) as an example tunneling mechanism.

## Decisions and Action Items
*   Authors to update drafts based on feedback received.
*   Presenters to share information on the mailing list to continue the discussions.
*   The WG chairs will help to find the proper place for the "Network Computing Operation" draft.

## Next Steps
*   Authors to revise drafts based on the discussions.
*   Further discussion to occur on the mailing lists.
*   Possible presentation of updated material at the next IETF meeting.
