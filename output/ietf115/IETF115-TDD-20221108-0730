# Technology Deep Dive

## Summary

This session provided an in-depth look at various aspects of deploying, observing, and debugging QUIC.  Discussions covered practical experiences at Google with QUIC load balancing, mitigating blackholing, and handling zero-RTT issues, along with practical guidance on using Wireshark and qlog for troubleshooting.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **QUIC Load Balancing:**
    *   Discussed challenges of using Anycast with QUIC, particularly related to connection migration and flapping BGP routes.
    *   Highlighted the use of encrypted connection IDs within QUIC to improve linkability and routing.
    *   Quick LB draft has a single connection ID format. Rotation of keys is possible using configuration IDs.
    *   Goal is deploying by Q2 or Q1 of next year.
*   **Blackholing Mitigation:**
    *   Explained that five-tuples can be blackholed, causing connection timeouts and poor user experience.
    *   Described a strategy to close connections after five consecutive probe timeouts.
    *   Port migration (changing the client-side port) was presented as an effective solution to overcome blackholing.
*   **Zero-RTT Challenges:**
    *   Highlighted the complexity of implementing zero-RTT in QUIC due to multiple packet number spaces and key management.
    *   Shared experiences of a Google outage caused by a "contagion" bug related to resumption information sent by Google front ends. Key point was that rollbacks didn't work because the state was in clients.
    *   Emphasized the importance of thorough testing and robust tooling to ensure zero-RTT actually improves performance.
*   **Observing and Debugging QUIC:**
    *   Stressed that QUIC is not TCP, TLS, or HTTP; it's a new transport protocol with its own considerations.
    *   Emphasized the importance of understanding TLS for debugging QUIC handshakes.
    *   Discussed the use of Wireshark (version 3.4+) with SSL key log files for dissecting and decrypting QUIC packets.
    *   Highlighted the benefits of using qlog and cuviz for richer insights into QUIC connection behavior.
    *   Qviz is an excellent tool for visualizing QLOG output.
    *   Explained the importance of initial and handshake packet types.
*   **QUIC Applicability and Manageability:**
    *   Mentioned RFC 9308 - QUIC Applicability, which discusses transport protocol features and adapting an application to work on QUIC
    *   Mentioned RFC - Manageability Draft which discusses how to analyze quick.
*   **BGP over QUIC:**
     * There were multiple bgp over quick drafts.
     * The quick working group is available for early reviews.
     * Key distribution seems like a potential challenge.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Action Item:** Re-export the slides with the timeline for the Google Outage (Ian).
*   **Action Item:** George Michaelson asked if someone could write a library that allows single packet transactional work reliably across address Mobility.

## Next Steps

*   Continue deployment of QUIC load balancing.
*   Further explore and refine blackholing mitigation techniques.
*   Improve testing and tooling for zero-RTT implementations.
*   Address version ossification to ensure future-proof accessibility.
