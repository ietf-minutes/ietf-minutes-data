## Summary

This session explored the potential for forming an IETF working group focused on standardizing aspects of Extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF).  Presentations covered an overview of eBPF, implementations across different platforms (Linux, Windows, nvme, Android), and the position of the BPF Foundation. A significant portion of the meeting was dedicated to open discussion about the suitability of eBPF standardization within the IETF, addressing concerns about scope, expertise, and potential conflicts with the existing eBPF development community. Ultimately, a strong indication of support for forming a working group with a carefully considered charter was expressed, contingent on resolving licensing issues.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Licensing Concerns:** The IETF legal counsel has a generally positive initial assessment on licensing compatibility but further clarification is still required, and this is outside the scope of the meeting.
*   **eBPF Overview and Implementations:** Presentations covered eBPF architecture, usage in various operating systems, and use cases in networking, storage, and more.
*   **BPF Foundation's Position:** The BPF Foundation supports standardization but prefers not to be the standards body itself, seeing the IETF as a suitable venue.
*   **IETF Suitability:**  A central debate revolved around whether eBPF standardization aligns with the IETF's core competencies. Concerns were raised about standardizing a programming language or compile target.
*   **Scope and Charter:**  Discussions emphasized the need for a well-defined charter with initial milestones focused on documenting existing, deployed eBPF functionality and interoperability before venturing into new extensions.
*   **Implementation Experience:** Several attendees highlighted their real-world experience deploying eBPF in production environments, arguing for the value of standardization to ensure interoperability.
*   **Community Engagement:**  Strong participation from the eBPF development community was seen as a positive indicator.
*   **Potential for Forks:** The possibility of diverging implementations due to disagreements on standards was acknowledged, but the presence of key implementers at the meeting was seen as mitigating this risk.
*   **Security Considerations:** The importance of addressing security implications within the charter was emphasized.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Address Clarity of Problem Statement:**  Investigate the reasons behind the concerns expressed regarding the clarity and scoping of the problem statement (as outlined in the draft charter).
*   **Charter Iteration:** Refine the charter, focusing on the initial milestones related to documenting existing functionality,  incorporating clear scoping and an extension process, and addressing potential security considerations.
*   **Licensing Resolution:** Await final legal review and resolution of licensing issues.

## Next Steps

*   A side meeting is scheduled to further discuss follow-up actions from the BOF session.
*   Continued engagement and discussion on the mailing list.
*   If the legal issues are resolved positively, the Area Director will evaluate the results of the BOF and the updated charter to decide whether to charter the working group.
