# detnet

## Summary

This detnet meeting at IETF 116 covered a wide range of topics, including the status of working group documents, updates on controller plane framework and scaling requirements, and several proposals for data plane enhancements and queuing mechanisms. There was significant discussion regarding the interplay between application requirements and network configuration, as well as the need for clear terminology and common evaluation criteria.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Working Group Document Status:**
    *   A new RFC was published on detnet boundary.
    *   Discussion of liaison statements with ITU-T SG13 and potential responses.
*   **Controller Plane Framework:**
    *   Updates to the controller plan framework document were presented, including a new section on multi-domain aspects.
    *   Discussion on the placement of multi-domain aspects within the document (control vs. management section).
    *   Consideration of centralized, hybrid, and distributed control plane architectures.
*   **Scaling Requirements Draft:**
    *   Updates to the scaling requirements draft, including renaming and new requirements related to flow fluctuation, were presented.
    *   Discussion on measuring one-way delay and the necessity of synchronization.
*   **Topology YANG Model:**
    *   A dormant topology YANG model was proposed for reactivation, particularly in the context of 5G integration.
    *   Discussion on augmenting existing YANG models versus creating new ones, and aligning with ongoing work in related IETF groups.
*   **Queuing Mechanisms and Data Plane Enhancements:**
    *   Several proposals for queuing mechanisms (e.g., CBS, CBS-like, TCCF, S) were presented, along with simulation results.
    *   Discussion focused on bounded latency guarantees, jitter reduction, scalability, and implementation complexity.
    *   Proposals for data plane enhancements, including encapsulating time information and flow identification, were presented.
*   **Evaluation Criteria for Queuing Mechanisms:**
    *   A proposal was made to create a "spec sheet" for queuing mechanisms, outlining key characteristics and performance metrics to facilitate comparison.
*   **Interaction with Application Layer:**
    *   A presentation highlighted the need for applications to easily interface with detnet without requiring deep knowledge of the underlying mechanisms.
    *   A proposal was made for an extension header to encapsulate application-specific requirements.
*   **VP Scheduling Solution:**
    *   A VP planning scheme based on P in scaling data internet was introduced.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **ITU-T Liaison Response:** Scott Mansfield to propose a response to the ITU-T SG13 liaison, with input from the detnet working group.
*   **Controller Plane Framework:** Authors to consider moving the multi-domain section to the controller section and further refine the text based on the list discussion.
*   **Scaling Requirements Draft:** Address comments and incorporate feedback from the interim meeting. Open issues on Github for discussion and potential pull requests for document updates. Mailing list to be the primary channel for building consensus.
*   **Queuing Mechanisms and Data Plane Enhancements:** Schedule side meetings to discuss specific queueing proposals in more detail, with support from David Black.
*   **Topology YANG Model:** Authors to work with T's WG for document alignment
*   **DetNet Requirements for Slice Model draft:** Authors to work with T's WG for document alignment

## Next Steps

*   Continue discussions on the mailing list for all topics.
*   Schedule working meetings on specific solutions (e.g., queuing mechanisms) to dive deeper into the technical details.
*   Refine documents based on feedback and discussion.
*   Continue to coordinate with relevant working groups (e.g., T's) to ensure alignment and avoid duplication of effort.
