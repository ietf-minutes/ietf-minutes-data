## Summary

The Human Rights Protocol Considerations (HRPC) Research Group meeting focused on updates to existing drafts, a presentation on analyzing hacked and leaked data, a presentation on designing crypto for grassroots organizations, and a discussion of a proposed re-chartering. Key discussion points included the progress and unresolved issues in the "Guidelines for Human Rights Protocol Considerations" draft, the potential adoption of a new draft on intimate partner violence (IPV), and the implications of changing the group's name to Human Rights Policy Considerations.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Guidelines for Human Rights Protocol Considerations Draft:**
    *   Reviewer EC raised concerns about technical flaws and the need for clearer distinction between protocol properties and actor behavior.
    *   Doc shepherd reported that authors had responded to those comments and explained the reasons for disagreement.
    *   The group discussed the process for achieving consensus, the meaning of technical comments being addressed, and a proposed timeline for resolving the issues before the next meeting.
*   **Freedom of Association Draft:**
    *   Doc shepherd's review is complete.
    *   The draft has been submitted to the IETF chair.
*   **Intimate Partner Violence Draft:**

    *   Feedback was requested, including cases where technology fails to account for IPV or provides positive examples.
    *   Concerns were raised about potential conflicts with efforts to combat CSAM.
    *   Suggestions were made to broaden the scope to include other forms of surveillance and to analyze the design of apps used for stalking.
*   **Re-chartering Discussion:**
    *   The primary proposed change involves renaming the group to Human Rights Policy Considerations.
    *   Discussion focused on updating the charter text to include policy considerations.
    *   Aubrey inquired about whether changing the name opens the scope to include considerations about implementation/deployment.
    *   Lars suggested that the charter should be seen as describing and advertising the group to potential participants.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Guidelines for Human Rights Protocol Considerations Draft:**
    *   Authors (Neil and others) will work with EC to address concerns on the list within 30 days.
    *   After that discussion, the chair will poll the research group for consensus.
*   **Re-chartering:**
    *   Chair and Colin to refine charter text around the "guidelines to the IETF" language.
    *   Chair to share revised charter text with the list.

## Next Steps
