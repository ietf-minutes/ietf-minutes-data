# httpbis

## Summary

The httpbis working group met to discuss several ongoing drafts, including cookies, DNS aliases in the Proxy-Status header, and unprompted authentication. Discussions focused on clarifying existing issues, incorporating feedback, and outlining future directions.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Message Signatures:** A potential normative change related to encoding and retrieving octets was discussed. The consensus was to update examples and clarify intent. A PR will be created and circulated for review, with a new draft released shortly thereafter.
*   **Cookies:** The editor provided an update on draft-ietf-httpbis-rfc6265bis-11 and changes going into -12. Open issues include whitespace in cookie names and values (specifically Htabs) and same-site cookie handling during redirects. A timeline for working group last call was discussed (aiming for prior to IETF 117).
*   **DNS Aliases Proxy Status Header:** Two open issues were identified and pull requests were created. Discussions centered on including the full CNAME chain in the next-hop-aliases parameter and addressing potential skipping rules, as well as a discussion around the threat model. The goal is to finalize the draft and enter working group last call before the next meeting.
*   **Unprompted Authentication:** Several issues were discussed:
    *   Registry for signature and hash algorithms. The group will investigate existing IANA registries and potentially create a new one if necessary.
    *   Concerns were raised about adding HMAC support. It was agreed to drop HMAC support for now and focus on signature schemes. Existing TLS signature schemes may be used.
    *   Reusing the existing Authorization header was discussed. The group will investigate potential issues with user agents not recognizing new schemes and will consider renaming the draft to reflect its focus on channel-bound authentication schemes.
    *   Discussion around exporter contexts with the proposal being to include the algorithm in use, the key identifier as well as the origin.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Message Signatures:**
    *   Justin will update examples and clarify intent in a PR.
    *   A new draft will be released after PR review.
*   **Cookies:**
    *   Stephen will continue to work on resolving the same-site redirect issue.
    *   Working group last call to be targeted for before IETF 117.
*   **DNS Aliases Proxy Status Header:**
    *   Tommy to revise the document to include the PR and additional reviews.
    *   Ben to create issue for skipping rules that are not totally right
    *   Chris to file an issue outlining how the Proxy is doing DNS, and what are the implications.
    *   Discuss list vs string format after the meeting.
    *   Tommy will include the full CNAME chain in the next-hop-aliases parameter.
    *   Target working group last call for before the next meeting.
*   **Unprompted Authentication:**
    *   David will investigate existing IANA registries for signature and hash algorithms.
    *   David will drop HMAC support.
    *   David will use the existing Authorization header and look into proxy authorization, but also ensure that existing protocols will continue to work.
    *   David will check there are no explicit bans on using Basic or Digest without four zero one.
    *   David will add context information in the Tls key exporter including which algorithm, key identifier, and origin and excluding URL.
    *   David will talk with Jonathan (from Cloudflare) on security analysis.
    *   David will reuse realm instead of URL.
    *   Comment on issue that is about adding context string next to nonces.
    *   Name the draft after "channel bound"

## Next Steps

*   The discussed PRs and drafts will be updated and circulated for review.
*   The chairs will monitor the progress on these documents and determine the next steps, including whether to initiate working group last calls.
*   The working group will continue to discuss the outstanding issues on the mailing list.
