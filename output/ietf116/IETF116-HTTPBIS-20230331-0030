# httpbis

## Summary

The httpbis working group met to discuss several draft specifications, including uploads, structured fields, retrofit headers, and an alternative to Alt-Svc.  A new proposal regarding Websocket discovery and detection was presented.  The group also discussed modernizing HTTP proxies. Several decisions were made to proceed with working group last calls on certain specifications while continuing discussions on others.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Uploads Draft:**  Discussion focused on the use of server-generated upload tokens, the `Upload-Incomplete` header, and error handling for incomplete uploads.  Retry behavior on 500 errors and naming conventions were also debated.

*   **Structured Fields Draft:** Addressed the issue of non-ASCII characters in strings.  Options were explored, including adding a new type to handle Unicode characters. A decision was made to initiate working group last call while continuing discussions on the non-ASCII character issue.

*   **Retrofit Headers Draft:**  Debated retrofitting the Authorization and WWW-Authenticate headers. Concerns were raised about scheme-specific information and implications for future extensions.  A middle ground was proposed to define mappings for basic and digest authentication initially, with the possibility of other schemes defining their own mappings.

*   **Alternative to Alt-Svc (DNS-Based):** Mike Bishop presented an alternative to Alt-Svc that relies on DNS SRV and HTTPS records.  Discussion centered on the loss of the ability to point directly to IP addresses, the requirement for alternatives to be equivalent or better, and the stickiness of alternatives. Several participants voiced concerns about the complexity. There was also discussion on a new service parameter.

*   **Websocket Discovery and Detection:** Lucas Pardue presented a new proposal about how to best serve WebSockets over H2 and H3. Discussion centered on how clients will discover the versions that the server supports, latency, and the desire for solutions that do not require clients to figure out which version supports which features.

*   **Modernizing HTTP Proxies:** A proposal was presented to modernize HTTP proxies using a mechanism similar to connect UDP and connect IP.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Structured Fields Draft:**
    *   **Decision:** Initiate working group last call.
    *   **Action Item:** Mark Nottingham to publish the current draft and start the last call process.
    *   **Action Item:** Start technical discussions about non-ASCII characters.
    *   **Action Item:** Form a design team to come up with a proposal for handling non-ASCII.

*   **Retrofit Headers Draft:**
    *   **Decision:** Further resolve the issues on Authentication and authorization before last call.
    *   **Action Item:** Mark Nottingham to investigate the Auth schemes further before moving on.

*   **Alternative to Alt-Svc (DNS-Based):**
    *   **Action Item:** Investigate service parameter names in DNS.
    *   **Action Item:** Continue discussion on stickiness and label usage on the mailing list.
    *   **Decision:** Adopt the draft and Obsolete 7838 with it, and keep this separate work item.

*   **Websocket Discovery and Detection:**
    *   **Action Item:** Form a design team to further discuss and refine the proposals. Kenrick to be the point of contact for credit coordination.

*   **Modernizing HTTP Proxies:**
    *   **Action Item:** Take the discussion to the mailing list and possibly initiate a call for adoption.

## Next Steps

*   Continue discussions on open issues for each draft on the mailing list.
*   Publish updated drafts with agreed-upon changes.
*   Initiate working group last calls for stable drafts.
*   The next meeting will take place at IETF 117.
