# icnrg Meeting Minutes

## Summary

The ICNRG meeting covered updates on ongoing projects, including Flick, and discussions on new research directions, such as media streaming in ICN and loss detection mechanisms. Presentations highlighted the relevance of ICN technologies for emerging applications like AR/VR and the metaverse, with a focus on scalability, low latency, and security.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Flick Update:** Updates on Flick, a tool for discovering network capabilities in ICN, focusing on manifest structures, name construction, and routing hints for efficient content retrieval.
*   **Reflex Forwarding:** Discussion on extending the existing ICN protocols with multi-way handshakes for use cases like data pushing and session continuation. Focus on the need for implementations and potential adoption as an ICNRG work item.
*   **Media over QUIC (Quicker):** Presentation on using ICN principles for media delivery in AR/VR and large-scale collaboration scenarios. The work seeks to address requirements around low latency, high scalability, and sovereign data handling.
*   **ICN for Media Streaming:** Exploring the potential of ICN for metaverse applications, including challenges related to object management, ownership, and decentralized content distribution.
*   **Loss Detection in ICN:** Introducing a probe-based approach for loss detection in ICN, aiming to improve timeout mechanisms and reduce false loss detection, particularly in scenarios with cache misses and remote producers.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Flick:** Encourage community feedback on the Flick draft, specifically regarding the implementation and usage.
*   **Reflex Forwarding:** Assess community interest and support for adopting Reflex Forwarding as an ICNRG work item.

## Next Steps

*   Share slides and documents discussed in the meeting with the ICNRG mailing list.
*   Continue discussions on Reflex Forwarding adoption via the mailing list.
*   Follow up on the discussion regarding congestion collapse issue that can arrise from caching multiple bitrates in the Quick over ICN implementation.
*   Explore potential collaborations and synergies between the different projects presented, particularly Quick over ICN, routing overlays, and media distribution.
