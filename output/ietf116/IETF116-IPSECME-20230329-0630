## Summary

The IPsecME meeting covered several topics, including improvements to optimized rekeying, a novel approach for mixing pre-shared keys, extending the IKEv2 format, anti-replay sequence numbers, managing fragmentation, and introducing new traffic selectors.  Several drafts were discussed, and working group adoption was considered for some. The meeting also discussed future directions for working group efforts.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Optimized Rekeying (Dark Mode):** Discussed handling of SPIs, when to send optimized IKEv2 supported payloads, handling P values during rekeying of child SAs, and management of negotiated notifies related to child SA properties.  Concerns about potential vulnerabilities due to changing cryptographic parameters during rekeying were voiced. The discussion also included what error handling should look like if optimized rekeying failed.

*   **Mixing Pre-Shared Keys (Valerie):**  Presented an alternative approach for using pre-shared keys with IKEv2 to provide protection against quantum computers, especially concerning group key management. Discussion covered the proper behavior if a group controller doesn't support the proposed protocol, and the importance of a key confirmation mechanism. There was a key finding in an issue on key confirmation that needed to be fixed.

*   **Extended IKE Format (Valerie):** Discussed various modifications to IKEv2, including making it more compact and supporting larger payloads. Debate ensued about treating compression and large payloads separately and implementing compression profiles.

*   **Anti-Replay Sequence Number Spaces (Mo from Cisco):** A new version of a draft concerning anti-replay sequence number spaces was discussed.  The proposal involves increasing the size of the sequence number field and adding a transform for negotiation.  Memory usage scaling with the number of child SAs was a key concern, advocating for increased sequence number size instead of numerous child SAs.

*   **Maximum Atomic Packet (Daniel):** Focused on limiting fragmentation through notification payloads, with the key goal of avoiding reassembly and ensuring packets don't exceed limits. Two notifications were defined:  Link Maximum Atomic Packet (LMTA) and Packet Too Big. A fundamental disagreement was highlighted regarding the role of routers and fragmentation in the design.

*   **DSCP Traffic Selector (Daniel):** Discussed introducing new traffic selectors based on DSCP values. The main benefit is easier management when using the same DSCP values for traffic. One concern was it being used to define access control.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Optimized Rekeying (Dark Mode):** The authors will improve the text regarding SPI handling. Further discussion needed on the mailing list on what error handling looks like for this draft.
*   **Mixing Pre-Shared Keys (Valerie):** Valerie will add a key confirmation mechanism (like a SKEYSEED) to ensure keys are consistent. The chairs will start a working group adoption call.
*   **Extended IKE Format (Valerie):** A poll will be conducted to determine whether to work on large payloads. The draft should be split into two different drafts: one for payload compression and one for large payloads.
*   **Anti-Replay Sequence Number Spaces (Mo from Cisco):** Encourage readers to read and comment on the list.
*   **Maximum Atomic Packet (Daniel):** Continue discussion on the list.
*   **DSCP Traffic Selector (Daniel):** The authors should continue the discussion on the mailing list to address the concerns raised.
*   **Drafts affecting Routing:** A virtual interim meeting will be scheduled to discuss drafts affecting routing, and the routing group will be notified.

## Next Steps

*   Authors will revise drafts based on meeting feedback.
*   Chairs will initiate adoption calls for selected drafts.
*   Further discussion on open issues will occur on the mailing list.
*   A virtual interim meeting will be scheduled for drafts impacting routing.
