## Summary
The LISP working group meeting covered updates on document statuses, presentations on LISP Next, satellite networks, and signal-free multi-homing, and a detailed discussion about future charter directions, including moving experimental documents to standard track, security/privacy considerations, and use case documentation.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Document Status Updates:**
    *   English name and encoding is waiting for write-up.
    *   Pops Up has been submitted for publication.
    *   YANG model is ready to move forward.
    *   NextGen draft was returned and needs to be reworked.
*   **LISP Next & Vehicle Networks (Dino):**
    *   Discussed network virtualization and function distribution use cases.
    *   Highlighted the use of LISP Next for geolocation functions and distributed compute in vehicles.
    *   Debated the cost effectiveness of using vehicle GPUs for cloud computing tasks.
*   **Satellite Networks (Lost):**
    *   Presented updates on running LISP over satellite networks.
    *   Discussed testing efforts, including decentralized NAT.
    *   Addressed questions regarding compatibility with existing NAT implementations and L3 support.
*   **Signal-Free Multi-homing (New):**
    *   Presented extensions to signal-free multi-homing, focusing on multi-cast and mixed uni-cast/multi-cast scenarios.
    *   Discussed backward compatibility with existing deployments.
    *   Addressed questions related to the underlay network and interoperability.
*   **Charter Discussion (myself region):**
    *   Moving Experimental RFCs to Standard Track: 
        * Discussion on whether to advance RFC 6831 (LISP for Multicast) and RFC 8378 (Signal-free Multihoming).  Considerations were raised about merging the documents, backwards compatibility and deployment experience.
        * General consensus to work towards moving RFC 7215 (DD) to standard track. 
        * RFC 7215 would also have to be consistent with the current specifications.
        * Agreement to proceed with moving RFC 6836 (ALT) to historic.
    *   Mobility: Discussion of whether to maintain separate mobility RFCs, or consolidate in a larger document.
    *   Security/Privacy Work Item: Discussion of adding security and privacy as a working group effort and including RFC 8161 (Data Confidentiality). VPN was not considered to be security related.
    *   Reliable Transport: Moving this item to standard track to add a new protocol.
    *   Traffic Engineering (T): Debate about this item with the view that this RFC should be restructured in a different way.
    *   Use Case Documentation: How to document the use cases.
    *   New scope will be novel.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Decision:** The WG will work towards moving RFC 7215 (DD) to Proposed Standard.
*   **Decision:**  RFC 7215 will have to be consistent with the current specifications.
*   **Decision:** The WG will add a security/privacy work item to the charter.
*   **Decision:** the WG will address RFC 8161, moving it to standard track with reliable transport.
*   **Action Item:** Alberto will complete the process of moving RFC 6836 (ALT) to Historic.
*   **Action Item:** Send comments to the mailing list on what you don't think about the tv document.

## Next Steps

*   Re-evaluate the NextGen draft to align with protocol standardization goals.
*   Continue testing LISP over satellite networks and explore decentralized NAT solutions.
*   Further discuss and refine the scope of the mobility and security/privacy work items.
*   Prepare a revised charter reflecting the discussed priorities.
