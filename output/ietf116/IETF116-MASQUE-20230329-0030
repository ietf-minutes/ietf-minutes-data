## Summary

This MASQUE IETF meeting covered several individual draft proposals and discussed future directions, including advertisement discovery and potential adoption of new features. Key topics included a QUIC-aware proxy draft, Connect UDP with listener support, a transmission extension for HTTP datagrams, numbered HTTP datagrams, and HTTP data prioritization. The meeting also addressed open issues, security considerations, and potential for adoption by the working group.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **QUIC-aware Proxy:**
    *   Discussion around encrypting payloads of forwarded packets in quick mode to prevent traffic analysis.
    *   Debate on whether rein-encryption should be mandatory or negotiable.
    *   Proposal to create a design team with crypto expertise.
    *   Consideration of shifting encryption to a lower level (e.g., NIC) for performance.
    *   Discussion about virtual Connection IDs
*   **Connect UDP with Listener Support:**
    *   Requirement to allow the ability to get an exterior proxy IP address port so we need to learn what that is
    *   The design goal that clients can request and be assigned the same address import for future connections
    *   Concerns about potential use of the protocol in a way that could be blocked by firewalls.
    *   Discussion about whether all IPs should be able to send data to the client or if an allow list is needed.
    *   Proposal to compress away the IP and port information for compressed audio formats.
*   **Transmission Extension for HTTP Datagrams:**
    *   Discussion of congestion control effects on end-to-end connections.
    *   Concerns about potential performance issues in cascaded proxy scenarios.
    *   Discussion on whether the proposed implementation on the client device is appropriate
    *   The use of a transmission limit as a form of congestion control
    *   Concerns about running the experiments in a real world environment to determine correlation with losses
*   **Numbered HTTP Datagrams:**
    *   Use cases for reordering and deduplication of packets in 3G and non-3G scenarios.
    *   Concerns about the impact of the extension on QUIC streams and the design's usefulness.
    *   Clarification that the use of this extension is an optional mode
    *   Debate about duplication in multi-path QUIC and the use of data streams.
    *   Clarified its use for non quick applications.
*   **HTTP Data Prioritization:**
    *   Presentation of HTTP priority extensions to address issues with resource sharing on proxy servers.
    *   Guidance on how to merge various priorities
    *   Discussion about whether implementing HTTP data priorities would potentially solve a problem that the group is not supposed to address.
    *   Concern about prioritizing packets on control streams.
*   **Advertisement Discovery:**
    *   Discussion of discovering services by the client
    *   Discussion of split-dns functionality
    *   Split VPN configurations

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **QUIC-aware Proxy:**
    *   Authors will work with a design team with crypto expertise to address encryption of forwarded packets.
    *   The question of adoption depends on charter changes being approved.
*   **Advertisement Discovery:**
    *   Martin Duke will take the discussion to the IESG to find a more suitable working group if there is a desire to standardize this

## Next Steps

*   QUIC-aware Proxy: Form a design team with crypto expertise to evaluate encryption proposals.
*   Conduct further experimentation and real-world testing, particularly on loss correlation in cellular networks.
*   Further evaluate the charter text
