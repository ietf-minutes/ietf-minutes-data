## Summary
The Media over QUIC (moq) working group met to discuss several draft proposals related to real-time media delivery, relay architectures, and transport protocols. Key topics included scenarios for unified ingest and distribution, layering and adaptation strategies for large fan-out scenarios, object model requirements, and the integration of transport-level prioritization. A presentation was also given on deadline-aware relay extensions.

## Key Discussion Points
*   **Scenarios Draft:** The scenarios draft aims to define requirements for interactive real-time use cases, including unified ingest and distribution, relay architectures, and authorization. Emphasis was placed on supporting diverse network conditions and client capabilities.
*   **Layering and Adaptation:**  Discussion centered on the need for layering and adaptation strategies in large fan-out scenarios to enable scalable real-time media delivery.  Expressing dependencies between layers and objects was highlighted as a key requirement.
*   **Object Model:**  The working group discussed the object model and the properties that individual objects should have, including unique names, association with tracks and groups, and the ability to be cached and served individually by relays. Incremental delivery of objects (pipelining) was considered important.
*   **Transport Protocol Delta:** The focus was on building a unified media delivery protocol that can meet the requirements of both live streaming and interactive applications. A key debate revolved around tracks being tied to web transport sessions versus tracks that are independent data model.
*   **Prioritization and Bundling:** Discussion about prioritization focused on balancing flexibility for application-specific prioritization schemes with the ability to map to existing transport-level prioritization mechanisms. The concept of "bundles" as a prioritization domain was discussed, with differing views on whether it should be tied to transport sessions.
*   **Native QUIC vs. WebTransport:** A debate emerged regarding the need to support native QUIC in addition to WebTransport. Use cases for embedded devices and simplified implementations were cited as reasons for native QUIC support. Some raised concerns about increased complexity and discovery challenges.
*   **Deadline-Aware Relay Extensions:** A presentation introduced the concept of adding a "deadline" parameter to object headers to indicate the application's time sensitivity requirements. This could allow relays to make better decisions about scheduling and dropping overdue objects.

## Decisions and Action Items
*   The chairs will address the issue of users being unable to tag issues in the warp repository.
*   Authors to use the mailing list to discuss proposals or ideas.

## Next Steps
*   Authors to address use of mailing lists for proposals/ideas
*   Victor will work on including the bundle URL in a setup message, similar to WebTransport connect, to support native QUIC.
*   The group will explore sending catalog messages over a dedicated track with a separate draft for media-specific catalog formats.
*   Further discussion on the mailing list is needed to address concerns around bundling, prioritization, and the trade-offs between native QUIC and WebTransport.
