# moq

## Summary

This meeting covered several key aspects of the moq protocol, including catalog vacation, architectural issues (track independence and version negotiation), framing adoption calls, use cases/requirements draft updates, and a demonstration of an open-source proof-of-concept implementation. The meeting included significant discussion on track independence and associated naming/grouping considerations.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Catalog Vacation:** A proposal for catalogs for moq compliant streaming formats was presented. The discussion focused on decoupling the transport layer from the streaming format, the responsibilities of each layer, and how to address and serialize catalogs. Concerns were raised about how to pass changes to the web codec decoder config data when it happens in the middle of a stream.
*   **Architectural Issues:**
    *   **Version Negotiation:**  A simple handshake format similar to TLS was discussed for version negotiation. A suggestion was made to add a field for the streaming format to the handshake. There was concern about the potential latency introduced by an additional round trip.
    *   **Track Independence:** A major debate ensued on whether tracks should be independent components of the data model or if groupings of tracks should be baked in. Several viewpoints were presented, covering naming conventions, prioritization domains, orchestration domains, authorization, and the potential for multiple levels of grouping.  There was strong support for track independence and the separation of concerns regarding naming, prioritization and authorization.
*   **Framing Adoption Calls:** The chairs discussed the criteria for adopting drafts, emphasizing that drafts need not be complete but should represent a reasonable starting point for working group efforts.
*   **Use Cases/Requirements Draft Updates:** An update on the use cases and requirements draft was provided, including a timeline for adoption feedback and plans to merge content from the scenarios draft. The importance of generic requirements applicable to all media over QUIC drafts was highlighted.
*   **Open Source Demonstration:** A proof-of-concept implementation demonstrating ultra-low latency live streaming and live rewind was presented. It was built using web transport, web codecs and leveraged workers in the player. The implementation showed metrics about in flight request, dropping objects, and latency. The code was released as open source.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Version Negotiation:** The working group will proceed assuming the proposed version negotiation handshake will be used, and deal with any change requirements if they arise.
*   **Track Independence:** Tracks should be treated as independent components of the data model. Properties such as prioritization domain and orchestration domain should be handled separately from the track name. Colin to share a list of proposed properties with the note taker.
*   **Use Cases/Requirements Draft:** Ali volunteered to work on the terminology draft, potentially starting with a Google document and then moving to the IETF working group wiki.
*   **Interim Meeting:** The chairs will take the question of organizing an interim virtual meeting to the list.

## Next Steps

*   Chairs will start working on framing the Adoption call for the upcoming drafts.
*   Working group to provide feedback on adoption of the use cases/requirements draft by April 14th.
*   Spencer to merge content from the scenarios draft into the use cases/requirements draft.
*   Continue the discussion about prioritization schemes and relay behavior on the mailing list.
*   Explore the possibilities for the future use cases to leverage the new POC released from Jo.
