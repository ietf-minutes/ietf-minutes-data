## Summary

This meeting covered a range of topics related to OAuth and workload identity, including updates on existing drafts, discussion of client trust management, P security architecture, and the intersection of workload identity and SP. Discussions focused on clarifying existing specifications, identifying gaps in browser technology, and exploring potential solutions for secure storage of tokens. The meeting also addressed the need for clear guidance and collaboration between different communities working on related problems.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **SD:** Discussion focused on media types for SD, selective disclosure of individual array elements, and JSON serialization of SD.
*   **Browser Based Apps:** Discussion on a new section covering storage token options in browsers, particularly regarding HTTP-only cookies and the challenges of secure token storage due to browser limitations. A proposal was made to document the need for better browser API for storage token.
*   **OAuth 2.1:** Discussion on explicit resource owner authentication, repeated authorization requests, and scoping the native apps best current practice. Clarification was sought on the meaning of "involving the user" in authorization requests.
*   **Client Trust Management:** Discussed the challenges in externally managing client IDs across diverse ecosystems, and presented a proposal for a new authorization request parameter "client_id_scheme" to indicate the method used for client identification.
*   **P Security Architecture:** Addressed the revival of the proof-of-possession (P) architecture draft and its relevance in the current landscape. Discussions focused on aligning existing drafts with the terminology and potentially extending OAuth 2.1.
*   **Workload Identity and SP:** Explored the intersection of workload identity, SP (Software Platform for Identity on Resources), and OAuth. Identified seven use cases related to interability and a need for best current practices to enable developers to connect ecosystems.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **SD:** The speakers will take feedback on media types and other discussion points.
*   **Browser Based Apps:**
    *   Incorporate HTTP-only cookies to the drafts.
    *   The working group will reach out to the browser community to suggest a better API for storage token
*   **OAuth 2.1:**
    *   Clarify language around "involving the user" in authorization requests, focusing on consent and context rather than explicit authentication.
    *   Clarify that in some cases a silent refresh flow is needed, but be clear of the security implications.
    *   Scope native apps, best current practice recommendations, specifically to mobile operating systems.
*   **P Security Architecture:**
    *   The group will have more discussions regarding reviving the document.
*   **Workload Identity and SP:**
    *   The group will reach out to connect communities.

## Next Steps

*   **SD:** Review API feedback.
*   **Browser Based Apps:** Incorporate feedback and prepare for last call.
*   **OAuth 2.1:** Incorporate feedback from the meeting and prepare for last call.
*   **P Security Architecture:** Additional discuss regarding document revival and align with OAuth 2.1.
*   **Workload Identity and SP:** Documenting Use cases and creation of Best current practice for developer.
