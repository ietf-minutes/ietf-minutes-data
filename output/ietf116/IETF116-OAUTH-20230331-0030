# oauth

## Summary
This meeting covered several key topics related to OAuth, including job embedded tokens, cross-device flows, identity chaining, native apps, resource server metadata and authorization server discovery, and a new power of attorney-based authorization technique.  The discussions highlighted the need for improved security and usability across various OAuth implementations.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Job Embedded Tokens:**
    *   Discussion around embedding multiple tokens from different issuers into one.
    *   Concerns raised about potential confusion and security implications, particularly around embedding access tokens.
    *   Action item to address concerns and bring to the mailing list.

*   **Cross-Device Flows:**
    *   Focus on mitigating attacks that exploit cross-device authorization flows, where attackers trick users into granting unauthorized access.
    *   Discussion of pragmatic mitigations, alternative protocols, and foundational underpinnings.
    *   Consider using formal analysis to analyze protocols and mitigation effectiveness.
    *   Action item to connect with security usability researchers.

*   **Identity Chaining:**
    *   Exploration of preserving identity and authorization context information across microservices and trust boundaries.
    *   Discussion on different approaches: embedded tokens, embedded claims, and reference-based identification.
    *   Consideration of scalability and latency issues in microservices environments.

*   **Native Apps:**
    *   Addressing the challenges and security concerns associated with OAuth implementation in native mobile apps, particularly for first-party applications.
    *   Discussed potential solutions to provide a more seamless user experience while maintaining security, including a native apps flow parallel to the authorization code flow.
    *   Debate on whether to define the details of the back-and-forth communication within the flow or keep it out of scope.

*   **Resource Server Metadata and Authorization Server Discovery:**
    *   Presented two approaches for enabling a resource server to identify authorization servers: a well-known location for metadata and providing the issuer in a `WWW-Authenticate` header.
    *   Concerns raised about phishing attacks and privacy implications of disclosing authorization server information.
    *   Discussed the need for security considerations and ways to ensure the process breaks gracefully if the authorization server is unaware of the spec.
    *   Proposed combining both approaches.

*   **Power of Attorney based Authorization Technique:**
    *   Presented a new authorization technique based on the concept of power of attorney, allowing trusted devices or clients to act on behalf of a user, including multiple levels of delegation.
    *   Discussions on overlapping capabilities with existing authorization delegation models and Zebra.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Job Embedded Tokens:** Bring the draft to the mailing list and answer questions.
*   **Cross-Device Flows:** Connect with security usability researchers.
*   **Resource Server Metadata and Authorization Server Discovery:** Mike and Aaron will create a combined draft based on feedback.
*   **Power of Attorney based Authorization Technique:** Nat to review Zebra specification and explore potential overlaps. Sri to send the draft with the specifications to the mailing list.

## Next Steps

*   Continue discussions on the mailing list for each of the presented topics.
*   Schedule interim meetings to address topics not fully covered during the on-site meeting.
*   Develop combined drafts based on feedback and discussions.
