## Summary
This meeting covered two main topics: updates on the Oblivious Gateway Discovery draft and a discussion regarding the Oblivious HTTP Target Quota draft. The key discussion points revolved around consistency in key configuration and dough path discovery for the former, and the practical need and deployment scenarios for the latter.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Oblivious Gateway Discovery:**
    *   Recent updates included renaming parameters to use "ohai" instead of "oblivious" and clarifying the behavior for using oblivious HTTP for DNS (DoH).
    *   The major remaining issue is consistency, specifically key consistency and DoH path consistency.
    *   Key consistency: How to ensure the client has the correct key configuration for the oblivious gateway.  Referencing the privacy pass draft and possible inclusion of a concrete example of double checking were discussed.
    *   DoH path consistency: The current default of `/dns-query` might conflict with HTTP namespace conventions. Ben suggested hardcoding a path under `.well-known` for this. A suggestion was made to verify unknown paths but allow standardized paths.
    *   Eric suggested explicitly pointing to the privacy pass key consistency draft.
*   **Oblivious HTTP Target Quota:**
    *   The draft proposes a mechanism for targets to signal overload to the relay, enabling fair distribution of requests without penalizing all clients.
    *   Past feedback regarding limiting subsets of clients was addressed, with the draft now focusing on rate limiting all clients and preventing relays from targeting specific clients.
    *   Chris questioned the practical need, stating that Cloudflare hasn't required it.
    *   The discussion focused on potential use cases where the relay and gateway have weaker trust relationships, and the need for concrete examples to justify the adoption of the target quota policy.
    *   Alex raised concerns on deployment size assumptions within the draft (if gateways are larger than targets).

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Oblivious Gateway Discovery:**
    *   Update the draft to point to the Privacy Pass key consistency document.
    *   Add text about DoH path consistency and potential solutions, referencing Ben's suggestions.
*   **Oblivious HTTP Target Quota:**
    *   Initiate an adoption call on the mailing list to gauge interest and enthusiasm for the functionality.

## Next Steps

*   **Oblivious Gateway Discovery:** Authors to update the draft based on the decisions. Once the draft addresses the points discussed the chairs will move towards a last call.
*   **Oblivious HTTP Target Quota:**  Chairs to initiate an adoption call on the mailing list.
