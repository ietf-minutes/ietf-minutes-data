## Summary

The panrg meeting at IETF 116 was a short session focused on updates on the SCION architecture and a presentation about a side meeting on trust-based networking.  Key discussion points included the progress of SCION drafts, potential integration with IPv6 extension headers, and plans for a more in-depth SCION discussion at IETF 118 in Prague. The group also discussed whether to meet at IETF 117 in San Francisco.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **SCION Updates:**
    *   SCION is being deployed in the finance industry in Switzerland and expanding to other industries like healthcare and education.
    *   The SCION association has been created to improve and grow the SCION community and maintain the open-source implementation.
    *   Three main SCION drafts are in progress: component analysis, overview, and control plane. The Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) draft has been published.
    *   Terminology in the drafts is being updated to align with the positive networking graph vocabulary, including renaming "end hosts" to "endpoints."
    *   Potential integration of IPv6 extension headers for the data plane is being considered, but further research and prototyping are needed.
*   **SCION Draft Roadmap:**
    *   The goal is to complete the three main SCION drafts (component analysis, overview, and control plane) in the coming months.
    *   A detailed discussion on SCION is planned for IETF 118 in Prague, with the aim of having the data plane document ready by then.
    *   Operational experiences with SCION deployments in Switzerland will also be presented at IETF 118.
*   **Trust-Based Networking Side Meeting:**
    *   A side meeting on trust-based networking is being organized to explore topics such as robust geolocation, trust modeling, and the role of trust in avoiding problems related to entity positions in the network.
    *   The work has potential connections to SCION and its PKI.
*   **IETF 117 San Francisco Meeting:**
    *   The chairs proposed not to have a formal meeting at IETF 117 in San Francisco due to lack of agenda items. However this can be revisited.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Decision:**  A detailed SCION discussion will be held at IETF 118 in Prague.
*   **Action Item:** Yu to provide a summary of the trust-based networking side meeting to the panrg mailing list.
*   **Action Item:** Chairs to solicit further feedback on San Francisco meeting via mailing list.

## Next Steps

*   Continue working on the SCION drafts and prepare for presentation and discussion at IETF 118 in Prague.
*   Follow up on potential IPv6 extension header integration.
*   Review the summary of the trust-based networking side meeting and explore potential collaboration opportunities.
