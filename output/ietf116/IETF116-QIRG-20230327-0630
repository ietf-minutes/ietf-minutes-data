## Summary
The Quantum Internet Research Group (QIRG) meeting featured presentations on quantum network testbeds in the Netherlands, the US (Illinois Express Quantum Metropolitan Area Network - IEQMAN), and Japan, followed by an update on the quantum internet use case draft. Additionally, there was a presentation of entanglement delivery using a quantum stack and an announcement about a new book on quantum communications.

## Key Discussion Points
*   **Netherlands Quantum Network Testbed:** Development of a national quantum network connecting academic, telecom, and end-user sites. Focus on hardware, software, standardization, and use-case applications.
*   **Illinois Express Quantum Metropolitan Area Network (IEQMAN):** Design and implementation of a metropolitan-scale quantum network using deployed optical fiber. Architecture focuses on flexibility, coexisting classical/quantum information, and centralized control.
*   **Japanese Quantum Network Development:** Vision for a world of quantum data, connecting quantum computers and enabling secure quantum communication. Focus on integrating quantum memory and networking technologies.
*   **Quantum Internet Use Case Draft:** Addressing comments and preparing for research group last call. Removal of overly strong claims and updates based on recent IETF radiation documents.
*   **Entanglement Delivery Using Quantum Stack:** Experimental demonstration of a programmable quantum network node and stack. Focus on delivering entanglement, demonstrating the feasibility of running simple applications with minimal overhead.
*   **Quantum Communications Book:** Publication of a textbook on quantum communications, with the aim to provide introductory material for undergraduates. The textbook is open source and includes exercises.

## Decisions and Action Items
*   **Use Case Draft:** Issue research group last call on the mailing list with a two week response window.
*   **All:** Provide feedback on the newly published quantum communications book.

## Next Steps
*   Circulate the version 15 of the Use Case draft to the mailing list for last call.
*   Continue development and experimentation on quantum network testbeds.
*   Further explore use cases for quantum internet technology.
