# rtgwg Meeting Minutes

## Summary

The RTGWG meeting covered several draft proposals and updates, including alternative service routing, blockchain applications in BGP, a protocol assistant for troubleshooting, advanced topologies for data centers, tactical traffic engineering, and requirements for network fault detection. Several presentations were given, followed by Q&A and discussion.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Alternative Service Routing (ROSA):**
    *   Discussed the motivation for in-band, on-path service discovery as an alternative to DNS-based solutions.
    *   Presentation of updates to the draft, including new use cases (e.g., interconnect, mobile applications, video delivery), analysis of benefits, and relation to existing standards.
    *   Concerns about the destination header in IPv6 and potential solutions discussed.
    *   Debate about deploying ROSA over an IP network.

*   **Blockchain for BGP:**
    *   Explored potential applications of distributed consensus systems (DCS) like blockchain in BGP.
    *   Discussed key challenges: update latency, costs (communication), and working with inconsistent state.
    *   Potential use cases include avoiding origin AS assignments and validating updates.
    *   Feedback suggested the work may be better suited for the IRTF. Concerns were raised about applicability to existing authorities.

*   **Protocol Assistant (PAS):**
    *   Presented a protocol assistant for troubleshooting, a semi-centralized approach to gather troubleshooting data.
    *   Discussed use cases, including peer disconnect detection, route interruption detection, and OAM event correlation.
    *   Discussion of implementation as a new protocol vs. using existing GRASP mechanisms.
    *   Concerns about the query mechanism and notification of failures.

*   **Dragonfly Flight Power:**
    *   Discussion of Dragonfly and Dragonfly+ topologies for data centers.
    *   Focus on reducing network diameter, improving scalability, and enhancing path diversity.
    *   Concerns about path hunting and congestion control.

*   **Tactical Traffic Engineering:**
    *   Proposed a solution to detect congestion in real-time and move traffic using backup tunnels.
    *   Addressed recognition of congestion, flow manipulation, downstream congestion mitigation, and flow selection.
    *   Questioned action being local and not global.
    *   Concerns about out of order packets.

*   **Requirements for Network Fault Detection:**
    *   Presented a framework to accelerate fault detection for high-performance applications.
    *   Discussed the benefits of network-assisted fault detection.
    *   Questioned failure detection vs. notification.

*   **GP6 Updates:**
    *   Overview of the GP6 work and history.
    *   Valuable use case to justify the scope and value of API's.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Blockchain for BGP:** Consider moving the work to the IRTF based on feedback received. Facilitate discussions with relevant stakeholders to assess feasibility.
*   **All Presentations:** The RTGWG requests future presentation to include problem statements that progress WG efforts.
*   **All:** Continue discussions on the mailing lists.

## Next Steps

*   Authors to incorporate feedback into revised drafts.
*   Continued discussion on the mailing lists for each topic.
*   Set up virtual design team to work on GP6 API's.
