## Summary

This document presents the minutes for the TEAS (Traffic Engineering Architecture and Signaling) IETF meeting. The meeting covered updates on existing drafts, adoption calls for new drafts, and discussions on various technical issues related to network slicing and traffic engineering. Key topics included the applicability of Abstraction and Control of Transport Networks (ACTN) to network slicing, network slice YANG data models, and the realization of network slicing in IP/MPLS networks, particularly in the context of 5G.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **ACTN Applicability Draft:** Discussion around adding a discussion point and potential requirement for an X-interface Northbound from the MDSC for network slice orchestration requests.
*   **Network Slice YANG Data Model:** Concerns raised regarding the definition and meaning of "isolation" in the YANG model and its relation to VPN+ discussions. The proposal of using horizontal or vertical realization for cloud RAN use cases was discussed.
*   **Realizing Network Slicing in IP/MPLS:** Focus on reusing existing IP/MPLS technologies for 5G slicing, mapping 5G QoS requirements to transport network behaviors.
*   **Network Slice Association:** Discussion on the relationship between the NBA (Network Business Architecture) YANG model and service/network models and potential for merging content into the ACTN applicability document.
*   **Network Slice Architecture:** This area focuses on understanding and realizing model architectures based on defined network parameters.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **ACTN Applicability Draft:** Authors to address the issue of X-interface Northbound.
*   **Network Slice YANG Data Model:** Working group to find a solution for the definition of "isolation" that satisfies everyone.
*   **Network Slice Association:** Authors to discuss merging content into the ACTN applicability document.
*   **Adoption Call for Network Slice Application Draft:** Call for adoption will proceed.

## Next Steps

*   Authors to update drafts based on the discussion points.
*   Working group members to review updated drafts and provide feedback on the mailing list.
*   Continue discussions on open issues on the mailing list.
*   The team will align with the latest version of the NBA young model.
