# v6ops

## Summary

The v6ops meeting covered several important topics related to IPv6 deployment and operation. Presentations included updates on IPv6 education initiatives, frameworks for IPv6 as a service, operational issues with hop-by-hop options, prefix delegation in home networks, CDN behavior with IPv6 extension headers, using DHCPv6 prefix delegation, IPv6 multi-homing, and IPv6-only resolvers in NAT64 environments. Discussions were lively, reflecting the ongoing challenges and potential solutions for broader IPv6 adoption.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **IPv6 Textbook for College Students:**  Progress is being made, with contributions and commits steadily increasing.
*   **IPv6 for Enterprise:** Work is ongoing to address IPv6 deployment challenges in enterprise networks.
*   **Framework for Multi-IP Network & IPv4 as a Service:**  The draft has been updated based on feedback and is progressing.  The use of IPv6-only headers was proposed for brevity.
*   **Operational Issues with Hop-by-Hop Options:**  The draft is considered mature and ready for working group last call.
*   **IPv6 Prefix Delegation in Home Networks:** Discussion focused on hierarchical vs. flat delegation models and the implications for router configuration.  The benefits of standardising on the approach were discussed.
*   **CDN Behavior with IPv6 Extension Headers:** Testing revealed inconsistencies in CDN handling of extension headers, but improvements were observed. Discussion around proxy implementations in CDNs impacting EH functionality was discussed.
*   **Using DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation:** Proposal to use DHCPv6-PD instead of address assignment for IPv6 to scale the network resources. Concerns were raised about tracking user behaviour with it.
*   **IPv6 Multi-homing:** An informational draft outlining the challenges and options for IPv6 multi-homing was presented. There are operational challenges involved.
*   **IPv6-Only Resolver in NAT64:** Proposal to have IPv6 only the way to resolve. It addresses the case where some people are using Diana six four not sixty four.
*   **IPv6 stack migration:** Dual stack migration for in-house private cloud.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Hop-by-Hop Options Draft:** The draft is targeted for working group last call.
*   **Multi-homing Draft:** Additional text on the issues with using one address space on another provider will be added.
*   **Prefix Delegation Draft:** Add examples for host. The text related to Host and separate Pd were to be updated. The document will need some new text.

## Next Steps

*   Continue discussion on the IPv6 prefix delegation draft on the mailing list.
