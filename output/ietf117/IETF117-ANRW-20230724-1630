## Summary

The Applied Networking Research Workshop (ANRW) session covered a range of topics including IoT device location impact, programmable network infrastructure, and reflections on active network measurement in academia. Key themes included the challenges of DRAM scaling, the importance of representative network infrastructures for research, and ethical considerations in network measurement.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **DRAM Scaling Limitations:** The keynote speaker discussed the flattening cost per bit of DRAM, limited latency improvements, and approaching signaling limits which will impact future computer architecture and application design. Three types of memory (latency-optimized, capacity-optimized, and bandwidth-optimized) are expected to emerge.
*   **IoT Location Impact on MUD:** A presentation explored how user-defined location impacts IoT device network behavior, specifically domain usage. It highlighted the need for MUD (Manufacturer Usage Description) to account for location, and a DNS ECS extension was proposed as a solution.
*   **Programmable Infrastructure for Networking Research:** This presentation showcased Peanut, a programmable infrastructure for network research at UC Santa Barbara, combining active and passive measurements on a campus network. It addressed the need for representative data and emphasized the importance of ethical data collection.
*   **Reflections on Active Network Measurement:** This talk discussed the challenges and ethical considerations involved in active network measurement. It proposed a community-governed infrastructure to alleviate the burden on individual researchers.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Call for Experiment Submissions (Peanut):** The presenters of Peanut encouraged researchers to submit experiments for execution on their platform, providing email and website information for contact.
*   **Community-Governed Measurement Infrastructure (Tobias):** The presenter is building a community-governed infrastructure and will reach out to appropriate organizations to take ownership.

## Next Steps

*   The audience are encouraged to read the papers presented at the workshop, accessible on the ANRW23 website.
*   The audience can follow up with the presenters with further questions.
*   Explore the Peanut platform and the speaker, Roman, is contactable by email or through his website.
