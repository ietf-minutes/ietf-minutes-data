## Summary

This meeting focused on the future of the Internet in the next 20 years, with presentations and discussions covering network performance, refugee crisis mapping using Internet measurements, and research opportunities in security and privacy.  The panel discussion explored desired attributes of the future Internet, including ubiquity, sustainability, decentralization, and security, and addressed potential challenges from political opposition and societal collapse.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Network Performance:** Simon Mombauer presented research on the impact of TCP options (window scaling, selective acknowledgments, ECN), QUIC implementations (quiche, aioquic), and CDNs on throughput. Window scaling proved crucial, while QUIC implementations showed significant performance differences. Further measurements with longer durations are planned to understand these variances.
*   **Refugee Crisis Mapping:** Tal Rahan discussed using Internet measurements (Google Maps traffic, mobile device usage) to map the Ukrainian refugee crisis. Mobile device usage in Poland correlated strongly with refugee influx. The methodology aims to complement UN data using publicly available data for privacy preservation.
*   **Security and Privacy Research Opportunities:** Chris Wood presented research opportunities in the security and privacy space, focusing on the need for formally verified implementations and improved specifications.
*   **Multiparty Computation (MPC):** Identified as a hot research area, particularly around private heavy hitters and composition with differential privacy.
*   **Anonymous Credentials:**  Discussed as an ongoing research area with challenges in post-quantum security and practical deployment.
*   **Decentralization:** Panel discussion explored the meaning of decentralization in the context of Internet control and the increasing influence of large corporations. It raised concerns about data consolidation.
*   **End-to-End Encryption:** The panel debated the feasibility and challenges of achieving true end-to-end encryption in a decentralized and mobile environment, including identity management and potential government opposition.
*   **Impact of Quantum Computing:** The impact of quantum computing on Internet security and the progress made in deploying post-quantum cryptography was discussed.
*   **Fractured Internet:** A pessimistic view was raised that the Internet may fragment into distinct regions with differing access to information.
*   **Security Definition:** It was argued there is a lack of shared understanding in the security problem space. A technical solution might not solve societal problems and laws might be necessary.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Further Measurements:**  The presenter of the TCP/QUIC performance talk will conduct further measurements with higher iteration counts.

## Next Steps

*   Discussions and explorations of these topics may continue in related IETF working groups or research communities.
