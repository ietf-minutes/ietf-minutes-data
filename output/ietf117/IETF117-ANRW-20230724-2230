## Summary

The anrw session featured presentations on various network-related topics, including lowering barriers to working with public reliable data, DNS integrations, repeatable name resolution, multi-homed Hypergiant collaboration, and anomaly detection in large-scale BGP VPN networks. Each presentation was followed by a Q&A session.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Lowering Barriers to Public Reliable Data:**  Discussion centered around inconsistencies in publically available data from regional internet registries (RIRs) such as the use of different attributes for similar information and lack of historical data.  The presentation introduced a consolidated data format with identifiers and the complement of missing data.  Clarification was provided that the presented data came from public IRR data, not live whois queries.
*   **DNS Integrations:** Explored different types of DNS integrations (DNS-based and server-based) and challenges related to synchronization, domain lifecycle, and control. A call for collaboration was made to establish best practices for different types of DNS integrations. The suggestion of a BoF was made.
*   **Repeatable Name Resolution:**  Presented a method for discovering all DNS dependencies and identifying inconsistencies by building a complete dependency tree through building their own resolver. Zone cut discovery was discussed as well as querying consistent sets of TLD name servers to avoid overburdening them. Use cases and availability of data sets were covered.
*   **Multi-Homed Hypergiant Collaboration:** Discussed the problem of suboptimal server selection by Hypergiants for non-directly connected ISPs and proposed a collaboration model where ISPs provide additional information to Hypergiants. Retrospective simulation using real ISP data demonstrated potential improvements. Discussion focused on how selection could change the route.
*   **Anomaly Detection in BGP VPN Networks:** Showcased a framework (Daisy) for detecting anomalies in large-scale BGP MPLS and BGP SRv6 VPN networks, focusing on customer impact. Different data sources (IPFIX, BMP, YANG Push) were used, and customer behavior was profiled. The use of machine learning was discussed to build new checks.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **DNS Integrations:**  Explore the possibility of a BoF to discuss best practices for DNS integrations with different communities and organizations.
*   **Repeatable Name Resolution:** The presenter will make the data set available for further analysis and has received feedback to create a tool suitable for domain admins.

## Next Steps

*   Further exploration of collaborative opportunities for establishing DNS integration best practices.
*   Analyzing gathered data with repeatable name resolution and identify new interesting questions.
*   Continue working on the anomaly detection framework, focusing on performance and the impact of different network events.
