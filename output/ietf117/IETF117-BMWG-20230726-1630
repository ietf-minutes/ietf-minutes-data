## Summary
The Benchmarking Methodology Working Group (BMWG) meeting at IETF 117 included updates on several drafts, discussions on scope and methodology, and a presentation of test results. The meeting also honored the memory of long-time co-chair Al Morton. A new co-chair, Gisette Feocola, was announced.

## Key Discussion Points
*   **Draft Updates:** Discussions covered the pickup rate draft, stateful NAT64 benchmarking, container benchmarking, MPLS segment routing benchmarking, SRv6 benchmarking, and integrated space and terrestrial network (ISTN) benchmarking.
*   **Terminology vs. Methodology:** Bracko, the presenter for the Pickup Rate draft, discussed possibly shortening the terminology section of the Pickup Rate draft. Sarah Banks suggested the opposing view that the terminology section in the Pickup Rate Draft makes the document approachable.
*   **Stateful NAT64 Benchmarking:** Gabor presented updates to the stateful NAT64 benchmarking draft and got support for submitting the draft for working group last call.
*   **Container Benchmarking:** Bracko raised concerns regarding the scope of the container benchmarking draft and suggested comparing it with RFC 8172 and RFC 8204.
*   **SR MPLS and SRv6 Benchmarking:** A significant discussion arose around whether the SR MPLS and SRv6 benchmarking drafts should be combined into a single document, led by Karsten Wiese.  Arguments were presented for both sides, focusing on consistency of methodology versus the unique characteristics of each technology.
*   **ISTN Benchmarking:**  Key presented updates on the ISTN draft and faced questions regarding the accuracy of lab simulations and the applicability of results to real-world scenarios, particularly from Sarah Banks and Karsten Wiese.
*   **Test Results:** Vladimir presented test results using a young and netconf implementation on network equipment.

## Decisions and Action Items
*   **Action Item:** Gabor will make the changes in the Stateful NAT64 Benchmarking draft discussed in the meeting, submit the updated draft, and then it will proceed to working group last call.
*   **Action Item:** Authors of the SR MPLS and SRv6 benchmarking drafts will discuss offline, and present it on the mailing list, whether or not to combine the documents to come to a consensus on if a combine would be better for the IETF process.
*   **Action Item:** Authors of the Container Benchmarking draft will work to clarify the scope of the draft.
*   **Action Item:** Carsten Wiese and Joel Yegley will post their feedback on the ISTN benchmarking draft to the mailing list. Authors of the ISTN draft will review and respond to the feedback.

## Next Steps
*   Continue discussions on the mailing list regarding the scope of the container benchmarking draft and the potential combination of the SR MPLS and SRv6 benchmarking drafts.
*   Proceed with working group last call for the stateful NAT64 benchmarking draft after the updates.
*   Welcome the new co-chair, Gisette Feocola, and transition responsibilities.
