## Summary

This meeting focused on the status of several drafts, particularly the JS Contact drafts which are currently in RFC Editor queue. Robert provided an update on the changes made to these drafts since the last call, addressing feedback from the IESG. The meeting discussed the need for review of these changes and whether bumping the vCard version number is necessary.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **JS Contact Drafts:** Robert provided an update on the JS Contact drafts, highlighting the significant changes made since the last call due to extensive feedback. These changes included clarification of terminology, alignment of name data model with Unicode, addition of new address components, and a change in the semantics of the patch object.
*   **JS Contact vCard document:** Registration of a few properties for Chia's contact and vCard only useful for conversions.
*   **vCard Extensions:** Addition of new properties and parameters for vCard to facilitate conversion between JS Contact and vCard. Address and name properties were updated.
*   **Pronunciation:** Adoption of phonetic support for names in both vCard and JS Contact.
*   **vCard Address Property:** Splitting of the street address component into multiple components for better clarity, especially for non-Western addresses. The new values were tested with existing implementations, which ignored the unknown values.
*   **vCard Name Property:** Addition of support for secondary surname and separation of generations from honorifics.
*   **vCard Versioning:** Discussion on whether to bump the vCard version to 4.1 due to changes in address and name components. Implementers noted that many clients do not check the vCard version number, making the change potentially unnecessary.
*   **IANA Registry for vCard Address Label:** The `LABEL` parameter for vCard addresses is not registered in IANA, and the group agreed to add this to the JS Contact extensions draft.
*   **Interop Testing:** Calconnect would like to do some interop testing before publishing another set of drafts that might have issues to avoid what happened with the first go around.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Action Item:** Robert and Marianne to complete interoperation tests.
*   **Decision:** Kent committed to reviewing the JS Contact drafts within the next two weeks.
*   **Action Item:** Daniel to solicit additional reviewers from the mailing list for the JS Contact drafts, aiming for completion by the end of August.
*   **Decision:** Add the missing `LABEL` parameter for vCard addresses to the JS Contact extensions draft and include a reference to RFC 6350.
*   **Decision:** The group is inclined to *not* bump the vCard version, but further discussion is encouraged.

## Next Steps

*   Robert and Marianne to complete interoperation tests of JS Contact drafts.
*   Kent to review the JS Contact drafts and provide feedback.
*   Daniel to solicit more reviewers for the JS Contact drafts.
*   Robert to add the `LABEL` parameter registration to the JS Contact extensions draft.
*   Continue discussion on the mailing list regarding whether or not to bump the vCard version.
