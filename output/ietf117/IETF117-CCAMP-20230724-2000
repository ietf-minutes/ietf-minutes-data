# ccamp Meeting Minutes

## Summary

This CCAMP meeting covered a wide range of topics, focusing on updates to existing drafts and discussions around new areas of work, particularly those related to optical networking technologies and network slicing.  The meeting included presentations on optical impairment aware topology models, flex Ethernet models, OTN slicing, microwave topology, network inventory, ACTN and FCAPS integration, and pluggable optics management.  A new draft on integrating YANG configuration and management into ACTN systems was presented, sparking discussion about its scope and relationship to other working groups.  There was a discussion about different control plane options for pluggable optics.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Optical Impairment Aware Topology Model:** Updates included OMS protection tests, addressing comments from young doctors, and alignment with RFC 9090.  Discussion of how the model handles OTSI single protection with regenerators.  Consideration of potential impacts from new work on pluggable optics.
*   **Flex Ethernet Young Model:** Awaiting routing directorate and young doctor review in preparation for last call. Update to the flex with YAN to support multi-technology topology.
*   **OTN Slicing:**  The OTN slice model now directly augments the network slice MPI. The model has a dependency on a draft in the T's working group, prompting discussion about working group adoption of the network slice topology.
*   **Microwave Topology:**  Updates to align with the FlexGrid discussions on multi-technology support.
*   **Network Inventory:** Discussion about carving out parts of the model for use as the basis for a common model in the IV working group.  Exploring a more generic concept like "site" to replace the more specific "equipment room."  Discussion about manually provisioned inventory and outdated data.
*   **ACTN and FCAPS Integration:** A new draft exploring the integration of YANG configuration and management into ACTN systems.  Discussion about the relationship to service assurance work in T's and alignment with OXXA.
*   **Pluggable Optics Management:** Presentation on the applicability of ACTN to optical integration with pluggable optics. Discussion of two architectural options: packet and optical controllers having access to the packet node versus requiring communication between controllers. Consideration of control plane options.
*   **Performance Monitoring (PM) Management and Retrieval** Updates to add Yamodju's relating to PM interfaces, backpad EM module and RPCs to support operations.
*   **Additional option to what Oscar presented** Photonic controller has control of the photonic functions including the functions in the packet and device.
## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Optical Impairment Aware Topology Model:** Consider potential impacts from new work on pluggable optics when addressing remaining open issues.
*   **Microwave Topology:** Implement changes based on working group last call comments, including multi-technology support.
*   **Network Inventory:** Investigate moving parts of the model to the IV working group.
*   **ACTN and FCAPS Integration:**  Clarify the picture regarding the relationship between OSS and PNCs.
*   **Pluggable Optics Management:** Setup a meeting to check on the working group's interest on moving this as an auto draft forward.
*   **Transport NBI Design Team:** Update the charter, remove some members, and add of new members. The team will have a side meeting tomorrow between 10:11 AM at the golden gate for breakout meeting room.

## Next Steps

*   Continue discussions on the mailing list for all topics.
*   Work on the remaining open issues for all drafts, and plan for next IETF.
