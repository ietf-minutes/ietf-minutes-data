# coinrg Meeting Minutes - IETF 117

## Summary

The Computing in the Network Research Group (coinrg) meeting at IETF 117 covered a range of topics, including a review of coin advancements, research presentations on edge computing and share-nothing architectures, analysis of use cases and related research challenges, a terminology draft update, and individual contributions on security and SDN architectures. The discussion emphasized the evolution of coin beyond programmable switches to encompass distributed systems, AI integration, and edge computing scenarios.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Coin Evolution:** Discussion of how coin has moved beyond programmable switches (Tofino) to encompass broader programmable devices, distributed systems, AI, and digital twins.
*   **6G and Network of Networks:** Focus on edge, fog, and cloud integration in 6G, emphasizing machine learning, AI, and federated systems. Consideration of energy saving and sustainability in distributed systems.
*   **Edge Computing Architectures:** Presentation and discussion of "Orchestra," a hierarchical system designed for managing distributed edge computing environments, accounting for heterogeneity in devices and networks.
*   **Share-Nothing Architectures:** Exploration of share-nothing pipelines for generative AI at the edge, particularly in the context of mobility network functions and virtual cameras, leveraging parked vehicle compute resources.
*   **Use Case Analysis:** Discussion of the "use case analysis" document, with a proposal to rename it to better reflect its focus on research challenges and opportunities in computing in the network.
*   **Terminology Draft:** Deliberation on the status of the terminology draft, focusing on whether to publish it or maintain it as a living document, with an intent to ensure a clear definition of terms used by the group.
*   **Security in Coin:** Presentation on security features for coin, addressing both infrastructure security and security of coin programs, including key management and identity considerations in single and multi-tenant architectures.
*   **SDN Evolution:** Update on the evolution of the cooperating layered architecture for SDN, with the addition of a compute stratum and a telemetry plane.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Rename Use Case Analysis Draft:** Change the title of the "use case analysis" document to better reflect its focus on research challenges and opportunities. Jong Hung to lead this effort.
*   **Terminology Draft Status:** Maintain the terminology document as a living document, adding new terms as needed and clarifying existing ones based on group discussions. Consider publishing the document later, depending on traction within the research community.
*   **Address Security Feedback:** Paskoo to update the security draft to clarify the role of the user/device within the proposed security architecture.
*   **Review Class Architecture Diagram:** Update the diagrams of the class architecture to prevent the hierarchical structure and consider that the 3 dimensions are not in the same level.
*   **Interim Meeting:** Consider holding an interim meeting in late September to further discuss these topics. Co-chairs to coordinate.

## Next Steps

*   Continue discussions on the mailing list regarding specific technical points raised during the presentations.
*   Update drafts based on the feedback received during the meeting.
*   Prepare for the next coinrg meeting, potentially including more demonstrations and prototype implementations.
