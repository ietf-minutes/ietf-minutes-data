## Summary
This was the core working group session at IETF 117. Discussions covered updates on several drafts including core-comi, core-coma, core-href, dns-over-coap, attack-on-coap, kudos, oscor-capable-proxies, and coap-over-ble. Decisions were made on adoption of oscor-capable-proxies. An informal side meeting was scheduled for Friday to further discuss CoAP non-traditional responses, CoreClar, and locally significant URIs.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **core-comi and core-coma:** Discussion focused on extracting identifiers from YANG documents and RPC examples.
*   **core-href:** Focused on the representation of empty paths in TRIs (CRI references), with a preference for using "null".
*   **dns-over-coap:** Feedback received from Ben Schwartz (Meta) on using application DNS seabor and service bindings. Potential for collaboration with DNSOP. The strength of the root path recommendation was also discussed.
*   **attack-on-coap:** Discussion on mitigation strategies for replay attacks, specifically related to blockwise transfer. Proposed solutions involve extending request tag usage or typing eTags.
*   **kudos:** Discussion on splitting the ID update procedure into a separate document. Also discussed establishing an Xbyte registry and concerns around how the client initiate kudos.
*   **oscor-capable-proxies:** Concerns of lightweight-m2m use cases. It was proposed that clarification with D. Navarro would be benefitial.
*   **coap-over-ble:** Discussion on URI formats, with consideration of MAC addresses and locally significant URIs.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **core-href:** The authors will implement the use of 'null' for representing empty paths in TRIs.
*   **oscor-capable-proxies:** The working group decided to adopt the oscor-capable-proxies draft. Adoption call will take place over the mailing list. The author's will further collaborate with D. Navarro on use cases for lightweight-m2m.
*   **kudos:**
    * J. Hildebrand will need to follow-up on previous point about client initiate kudos.
    * A further discussion is needed whether this document should be split with IETF chair member Jaime after this meeting.

## Next Steps

*   Authors to address open points and feedback on the relevant drafts.
*   Resume interim meetings on August 30th.
*   Hold informal side meeting on Friday to discuss CoAP non-traditional responses, CoreClar, and locally significant URIs.
