# detnet

## Summary

This detnet session covered several draft updates and proposals related to deterministic networking. Key topics included enhanced data plane considerations, queuing mechanisms, flow interleaving, and application interfaces. The group discussed requirements for scaling deterministic networks, evaluated TSN mechanisms, and explored various queuing and scheduling approaches. Several presenters sought feedback and discussed future steps for their drafts. The session concluded with a poll indicating continued interest in discussing application interfaces for deterministic networks.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Enhanced Detnet Data Plane:** David Dial provided an update on open working meetings focusing on the enhanced data plane. Discussions centered on requirements, draft content, and evaluations of TSN mechanisms. The importance of in-depth presentations on queuing and scheduling mechanisms was highlighted.
*   **Scaling Requirements Draft:** Peng updated the group on the scaling requirements draft, including changes to bandwidth utilization, flow scalability, and handling flow fluctuations. The need for clarity in defining "flow fluctuation" was raised.
*   **TZQF Draft:** Yidro presented an update on the TZQF draft, focusing on merging different approaches and decoupling forwarding specifications from encapsulations. A demonstration of the technology over a large-scale network was shown.
*   **EDF Scheduling:** Shafu introduced updates to a proposal for Earliest Deadline First (EDF) scheduling, emphasizing rate control and sorted queues. Concerns were raised about the novelty of the approach compared to existing literature and the validity of latency calculations.
*   **Time-Slotted Queuing:** A presentation on time-slotted queuing explored resource reservation and conflict avoidance. Concerns were voiced about the practicality of Priority Input First Output (PIFO) queuing.
*   **GLBF (Guaranteed Latency with Buffering Forwarding):** Torlas introduced GLBF as a TSN-ATS solution with dampers instead of interleaf regulators. GLBF aims to achieve on-time delivery without per-hop state management.
*   **Latency Guarantee with Stateless Fair Queuing:** A new draft on Latency Guarantee with Stateless Fair Queuing was presented and the concept of ideal flow isolation was explained. There were discussions on entrance nodes needing to keep flow state.
*   **Clock Referencing Plane:** A proposal of new package queuing and compressing method.
*   **Flow Interleaving:** Torlas introduced the concept of flow interleaving as a means to maximize network utilization while maintaining minimal end-to-end queuing latency. The discussion distinguished between point-to-point aggregation and more complex interleaving scenarios within the network.
*   **Interface from Application to Deterministic Networks:** Karen presented their work to provide an interface from application to deterministic networks.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Enhanced Detnet Data Plane:** It was decided that the upcoming open meeting time slot be on Tuesdays at 8 AM US Eastern time.
*   **Scaling Requirements Draft:** Glenn Parsons suggested considering the use cases for deterministic networks. It was suggested to review the existing documents, and any comments should be sent to the mailing list.
*   **Open Action Items:** Authors were asked to self classify their mechanisms.

## Next Steps

*   Continue discussions on the mailing list.
*   Coordinate with solution documents for evaluation.
*   Refine documents based on feedback received.
*   Further develop Yang models.
