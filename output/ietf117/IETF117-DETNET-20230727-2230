# detnet

## Summary

This was a joint detnet and raw working group meeting at IETF 117. The main topics included the merging of the RAW working group back into detnet, a review of RAW documents and their status, discussion of the DetNet charter update, and presentations on 5G DetNet and traffic engineering extensions for DetNet.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **RAW/DetNet Merge:** The RAW working group is merging back into detnet. Open questions remain regarding the status of RAW documents.
*   **RAW Document Status:** A review of the status of various RAW documents, including architecture, technology, OEM support, framework, and industrial requirements drafts.  The disposition of each document was discussed, including actions for the detnet chairs and potential new co-authors.
*   **DetNet Charter Update:** Proposed changes to the DetNet charter were presented, primarily incorporating text from the RAW charter. The chairs solicited feedback from the working group, noting that the AD ultimately decides on the changes.
*   **Architecture Document Discussion:**  A detailed discussion around the RAW architecture document, focusing on terminology. Key points included the use of "protection path," the potential introduction and retraction of the term "lane," and the need for new terminology for "cross lane" concepts. Discussion focused on clarifying the roles and interactions of components, including the PSC/PLR and asynchronous control plane functions. New terminology like 'recovery graph' was also proposed.
*   **5G DetNet Presentation:** A presentation on a 5GS logical DetNet node, with a focus on YANG model extensions. Discussed 5G architecture, 2-way communication between 5G and DetNet domains, and proposed enhancements to the YANG configuration.
*   **Traffic Engineering Extensions for DetNet:** A presentation on traffic engineering extensions for DetNet to support differentiated queues. Discussed the need for different SLA guarantees, policy-based path steering, resource management, a layered model, and deterministic link modules. Concerns were raised about the similarity to existing IETF topology models.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **RAW Industrial Requirements Document:** Carlos will check in with existing co-authors, and if they don't respond will update the document.
*   **RAW Architecture Document:**
    *   The authors are awaiting approval from all contributors regarding IPR status.
    *   A new deadline for the working group last call will be set.
    *   Once the new version hits the mailing list, DetNet community should review the terminology.
*   **PLR (Point of Local Repair) Terminology:** Officially adopt PLR in place of PSC (Path State Component).
*   **Track Terminology:** Adopt the term 'recovery graph' in place of 'track'.

## Next Steps

*   DetNet chairs to send the proposed charter changes to the mailing list for further comments.
*   Authors of the RAW architecture document to continue updating the document based on feedback and to solicit further review from the DetNet community.
*   The 5G DetNet authors will further refine their work, considering potential reuse of existing YANG models, and investigate whether the work requires a new document or can be added to existing documents.
*   DetNet community should provide feedback on the traffic engineering extensions presentation, considering if the approach is the correct way to address differentiated queues.
