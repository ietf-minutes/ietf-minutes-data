## Summary

This meeting covered updates on SLP and advertising proxy, issues with SLP replication, TSR, future work options, and multicast stream discovery. The discussion focused on addressing name conflicts, scalability concerns, and redundancy in SRP environments, particularly in the context of Thread networks and Matter devices.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Advertising Proxy and Name Conflicts:** Discussion on name conflicts arising from multiple advertising proxy instances registering the same names, especially with the introduction of TSR. Renaming as a solution for MDNS name conflicts doesn't work well with Matter's name uniqueness requirements.
*   **Namespace Considerations:** Need to differentiate between actual name conflicts and namespace disambiguation issues in MDNS, SRP zones, and multiple links.
*   **Proposed Solution for Namespace Issues:** Consider SRP zones as distinct namespaces, handling left-most label conflicts differently to avoid MDNS conflict processes.  Explore options like appending a zone-specific identifier to names or leveraging the `service.arpa` domain.
*   **Scalability Issues:** Multiple registrars cause probing storms when replicating records. Need to address how to load balance and mitigate continuous probing.
*   **SRP Replication and Authority:** SRP clients act as authorities for their zones. Updates are signed, and the most recent update is authoritative.
*   **SRP Startup and Synchronization:** Challenges in SRP startup due to election processes leading to potential stalls. Need to refine the algorithm to ensure reliable service discovery. Current all-to-all connection topology (n*(n-1)/2) of SRP servers does not scale well.
*   **Limited Active Peers:** Apple's implementation currently limits active peers to 5.
*   **Controlling Active Peers and the Primary:** Proposal to have the primary SRP server manage which servers can be active to limit connections.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   Ted will post an updated version of the advertising proxy document today or tomorrow, focusing on the advertising proxy function.
*   Explore interim meetings to discuss namespace issues and SRP replication challenges within the DNSSD working group, rather than in other standards bodies.

## Next Steps

*   Continue the discussion on SRP replication challenges and solutions after the break.
*   Further discussion on TSR and experiences with conflicts.
*   Discuss future work options.
*   Discuss Nate's multicast stream discovery proposal.
