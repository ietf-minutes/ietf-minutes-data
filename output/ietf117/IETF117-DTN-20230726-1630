## Summary
The DTN working group session at IETF 117 covered several topics, including updates on the IPN URI scheme, network management architecture, COSE security context, EID patterns, a YANG model for BP, BP over Ethernet, applications over BP, and IPN URI allocator allocation. Key discussions revolved around interoperability, governance, and the best approach for various technical challenges.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **IPN URI Scheme Update:**  Discussion on service definition, the registry for well-known services, interoperability concerns, and allocation policies. There was disagreement on whether the bpv7 registry would be based on the existing bpv6 registry.
*   **DTN Management Architecture Update:** Clarifications around the DTNMA agent autonomy engine (now a policy execution engine), rule-based management, event condition action format for autonomy rules, and conflict detection.
*   **Data Model (ADM) Update:** Overview of changes to the ADM, including typing, handling failures, processing models for macros, expressions, and port templates. Discussion on separation of autonomy capabilities and encoding ADMs as a profile of the YANG modeling language.
*   **COSE Security Context Update:** Expansion of AAD scope to include other blocks in the bundle for signing/encryption.
*   **Bundle Protocol YANG Model:** Presentation of a YANG model for managing BP nodes, with early review considerations around node versions and neighbor CLAs.
*   **BP over Ethernet:** Proposal to put bundles directly into Ethernet frames, discussion of single sender/receiver agents, MTU, fragmentation, reassembly, and multiplexing BPV6 and BPV7.
*   **Applications over BP (HTTP, SMTP):** Discussion on informational documents describing application layer concerns when writing applications for delayed/disrupted environments. Questions raised on scope.
*   **IPN URI Allocator Allocation:** Concerns raised about potential bias or inconsistency in expert review for allocator ID allocation and consideration of hierarchical allocation.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **IPN URI Scheme:** Take discussion of the differences between bpv6 and bpv7 to the mailing list.
*   **DTN Management Architecture:** Request for working group last call to be handled on the mailing list.
*   **COSE Security Context:** The document is in working group last call; provide any feedback via the mailing list.
*   **Bundle Protocol YANG Model:** The chairs will post to the mailing list the request for adoption. Also provide links to BP EDM and MIB for previous versions of BP.
*   **BP over Ethernet:** Consider capturing current best practice into an informational document. Begin document on separating the bpv6 and bpv7 processing with focus on BPOE as a request for Ethernet ether type.
*   **Applications over BP:** Develop a generic informational document on application considerations for BP and keep individual drafts for HTTP and SMTP as personal drafts for now.
*   **IPN URI Allocator Allocation:** The ISG will be contacted about existing registry delegation processes. Working group members to suggest text for the designated expert description.

## Next Steps

*   Continue discussion on IPN URI Scheme and other topics on the mailing list.
*   Prepare for working group last calls for DTN Management Architecture and COSE Security Context.
*   Pursue work on informational document for applications over BP.
*   Request working group adoption of Mark Lache's bundle protocol YANG Model
*   Continue work on BP over Ethernet
*   Address concerns and refine the allocator allocation process for IPN URIs.
