# httpbis

## Summary

This httpbis meeting covered several active drafts and proposals, including resumable uploads, template driven HTTP connect over TCP, unprompted authentication, structured field values and retrofit, the query method, old service status, a report from the WebSocket's design team and a proposal for a header called request OTR. Key discussions revolved around versioning, dependency management, security considerations, and the overall direction of each proposal.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Resumable Uploads:**
    *   Clarification on the usage and naming of the "upload complete" header.
    *   Multi-versioning strategy for future iterations of the draft (suggestion for header suffixes).
    *   Adoption of byte range patch draft and its potential dependency concerns.
    *   Discussion on the feasibility of using informational responses to provide upload progress.
*   **Template Driven HTTP Connect using for DCP:**
    *   Concerns regarding the term "false start" and its association with existing terminologies.
    *   Implications of optimistic transmission in HTTP 1.1, security concerns and potential contradictions with RFCs.
*   **Unprompted Authentication:**
    *   The move to using HTTP authentication schemes instead of new headers
    *   The use of TLS key exporters to generate signatures.
    *   Discussion on adopting exported authenticators instead of designing something similar.
    *   Addressing potential attacks through key rotation and binding of key IDs to public keys.
*   **Structured Fields:**
    *   Discussion on the character encoding and case normalization for display strings (percent encoding).
    *   Impact of extensions in map fields and the choice to constrain future extensions.

*   **WebSockets Design Team Report:**
    *   Prioritizing the reduction of additional round trips when establishing WebSockets.
    *   Discussion regarding server agent rollback support, 100 logical consistency between h2andh3, and hop by hop proxies
    *   Potential Solutions and Their Limitations Including
        *   DNS Record Advertisement
        *   HP Settings Advertisement
        *   ALPN Negotiation

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Resumable Uploads:**
    *   Lock down "upload complete" as the preferred header name.
    *   Further discuss the adoption of byte range patch offline or on the issue tracker.
    *   Discuss the integration of upload progress via informational responses on the issue tracker.
*   **Template Driven HTTP Connect using for DCP:**
    *   Find a new terminology for "false start," potentially "optimistically sending."
    *   Address security concerns related to optimistic transmission in HTTP 1.1.
*   **Unprompted Authentication:**
    *   Investigate the feasibility of using exported authenticators instead of the current approach.
    *   Consider defining public keys and public ids instead of binding for authentication.
*   **Structured Fields:**
    *   Use uppercase for percent encoding based on RC 4648 with additional discussion and a second last call.
    *   The retrofit spec will be stepped back from to think about the right shape.
*   **WebSockets Design Team**
    *   The working group is asked to consider the issues related to WebSocket discovery.

## Next Steps

*   Authors to address action items and issues raised during the meeting.
*   Further discussion on the mailing lists for specific topics.
*   Another httpbis meeting to discuss remaining topics.
