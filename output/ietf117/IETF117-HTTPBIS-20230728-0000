# httpbis

## Summary

The HTTPbis working group session at IETF 117 covered several topics, including secondary certificate authentication, compression dictionary transport, availability hints, cache groups, invalidation API, gateway description, and a new HTTP response header for privacy. The discussions focused on adoption and technical details.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Secondary Certificate Authentication:** Eric presented a draft on secondary certificate authentication for HTTP servers, focusing on unprompted server authentication for H2 and H3. Jonathan raised concerns about client-side functionality.
*   **Compression Dictionary Transport:** Patrick presented an updated draft on compression dictionary transport, addressing previous privacy and security concerns. The discussion focused on the privacy protections and integration with browsers.
*   **Availability Hints:** Mark Nottingham presented an attempt to improve upon the `Vary` header with "Availability Hints." There was cautious support for exploring it further.
*   **Caching Specifications:** Mark Nottingham presented several caching-related drafts: Cache Groups, Invalidation API, and Gateway Description. Feedback varied on each draft.
*   **HTTP Response Header for Privacy:** Shivan presented a new HTTP response header aimed at improving privacy in browsers. Concerns were raised about its effectiveness and potential for misuse.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Secondary Certificate Authentication:** The working group showed interest in adopting the draft as a starting point, focusing on server-side authentication. Tommy created a poll to gauge interest. Result 20 for, 4 against, so the draft will be taken to the mailing list for a call for adoption.
*   **Compression Dictionary Transport:** The working group expressed interest in adopting the draft for compression dictionary transport. Tommy created a poll, which yielded positive results. Result 27 for, 0 against, so the draft will be taken to the mailing list for a call for adoption.
*   **Availability Hints:** The working group was less enthusiastic about adopting availability hints, although there was some support for exploring it further. Discuss on mailing list.
* **Caching Specifications**: No formal poll, but feedback will be taken to mailing list to drive further work.

## Next Steps

*   Post the secondary certificate authentication draft, and compression dictionary transport draft to the mailing list for a call for adoption.
*   Further discussion on the availability hints draft to gather more support and clarify use cases.
*   The new HTTP Response Header for privacy will be forwarded to the WebAppSec working group.
