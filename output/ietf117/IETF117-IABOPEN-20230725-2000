# iabopen

## Summary
The IAB Open meeting covered a variety of topics, including updates on IAB documents and programs, a report on W3C activities, an invited talk on Internet fragmentation and centralization, and a discussion on a proposed new program on identity management. There was also a brief presentation on RFC 9446 reflecting on pervasive monitoring.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **IAB Document Updates:** Discussion on recently published documents ("Maintaining Robust Protocols," "Application Network Collaboration Using Testing") and the upcoming publication of the MTM workshop report. Concern was raised regarding representation in the MTM workshop report and a plan to address community comments.
*   **ITU Liaison Issues:** A concern was raised about the lack of responses to liaisons sent from the ITU.
*   **ADM Program Update:** Update on the Availability, Deployability, and Maintainability (ADM) program, including the publication of a new draft on greasing and the upcoming presentation on code maintenance.
*   **Proposed Environmental Impact Program:** Introduction of a proposed new program focused on environmental impacts and discussion of its potential scope.
*   **W3C Update:** Martin Thompson provided an update on W3C activities, highlighting the organizational structure, technical areas of focus, and interactions with the IETF. Noted key differences between the IETF and W3C including mailing list vs Github for interaction and the IPR requirements
*   **Internet Fragmentation and Centralization:** Nick Merrill presented his research on Internet fragmentation and centralization, arguing that perceived fragmentation is often a response to U.S. control over key Internet infrastructure points. The dominance of US-based CDNs and the implications for global Internet control were discussed. Many comments were made on the presentation including questions and anecdotes.
*   **Proposed Identity Management Program:** Chris presented a proposed new program on holistic human-oriented discussions on identity systems (Huddl), aimed at understanding the landscape of authentication, credential, and identity technologies. Scope considerations, including whether to include machine identities, were discussed. There were concerns that such a discussion would become unmanageable.
*   **RFC 9446 Reflection:** Elliot presented an overview of RFC 9446 discussing the pervasive monitoring attack and the internet community's response.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **MTM Workshop Report:** The IAB will work with Sanu to address community comments and representation issues in the MTM workshop report.
*   **ITU Liaison Issues:** The IAB is already discussing the issue of lack of responses to ITU liaisons and encouraged Sanu to attend the Liaison Coordinators Office Hours to discuss further.
*   **Proposed Environmental Impact Program:** The IAB will continue to solicit feedback on the scope and direction of the proposed environmental impact program.
*   **Proposed Identity Management Program:** The IAB to consider narrowing the scope of the program to what the IETF can accomplish in the identity space with consideration to if the program can be productive.

## Next Steps

*   Publish the MTM Workshop Report.
*   Continue discussions on the environmental impact and identity management programs and refine their scope based on community feedback.
*   Address the ITU liaison issues.
*   Discussions of the topics and concerns raised should continue offline.
