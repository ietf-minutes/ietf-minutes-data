## Summary

The second IDR session covered several topics, including BGP Flow Specification extensions for Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN), secondary labels for BGP, BPLS extensions for security capabilities, path attribute escape, and source address validation architecture. Discussions revolved around protocol extensions, operational considerations, and potential solutions for identified problems.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **BGP Flow Specification Extensions for TSN:** Presented extensions for mapping TSN streams to flat flows and vice versa, including filtering rules and latency actions. Alignment with BGP FS version 2 and the Intransit Datapath working group was mentioned.
*   **BGP Secondary Label:** A proposal to use a secondary label in BGP to address label churn issues when using per-next-hop received label allocation mode in conjunction with prefix-independent convergence (PIC). The secondary label would be based on the primary path, aiming to improve convergence and prevent label exhaustion.
*   **BPLS Extensions for Security Capabilities:** A presentation on extending BPLS to carry security capabilities, including node, link, and prefix attributes. The motivation stemmed from the need for coordination across multiple regions with different security equipment.
*   **Path Attribute Escape:** A discussion on the operational problems caused by path attributes propagating outside their intended scope, leading to inconsistent route selection, black holes, and session failures. The presentation suggested building a taxonomy of common scoping criteria and exploring mitigation strategies.
*   **Source Address Validation Architecture:** Presentation of a source address validation architecture focusing on automatic updates and accurate validation. The architecture involves exchanging source-specific information to generate more accurate sub-rules than those based solely on routing information. Extending BGP to carry this source-specific information was considered.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **BGP Flow Specification Extensions for TSN:** Seek feedback from the IDR working group on the presented extensions.
*   **BGP Secondary Label:** Engage with the IETF regarding proper procedures for the proposed attribute.
*   **BPLS Extensions for Security Capabilities:** Add "TBD" to attribute codes until allocations are confirmed.
*   **Path Attribute Escape:** Socialize the ideas presented and engage with the operational community. Build a problem statement and start building mitigations, operational procedures, and potentially documentation.
*   **Source Address Validation Architecture:**  Welcome comments on the mailing list.

## Next Steps

*   Continue discussions on the IDR mailing list for all presented topics.
*   Present the "Path Attribute Escape" concept to other relevant groups, including the nogs.
