# jmap

## Summary

This jmap session covered several topics including sharing, Sieve, Calendars and Contacts, Esme, Tasks, Portability, Snooze, and Archives. Discussions centered around draft updates, implementation experiences, standardization efforts, and potential adoption of new features. Several action items and decisions were made regarding draft revisions, milestone updates, and calls for adoption.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Sharing:** Working group last call has expired. Feedback primarily focused on needing more examples for mail and calendar specifications.
*   **Sieve:** No feedback received during last call; considered ready to move forward.
*   **Calendars:** The specification is considered basically ready but dependent on the finalization of JS Calendar.
*   **Contacts:** Contact groups are now integrated into contacts, mirroring changes in JS Contact data format. Cards can belong to multiple address books. Mobile TV media are converted to JM app blobs. Defined server support for filtering and sorting.
*   **Esme:** Discussed signing and encryption of messages, header protection, and decryption using mail get. Consideration of extracting email addresses of recipients from encrypted Spineblobs. Queried usefulness of identifying encrypted messages via email query.
*   **Tasks:** No significant progress since the last IETF.
*   **Portability:** Discussed a minimal version of JMAP for portability use cases. The document now returns constant values and errors rather than omitting properties. Discussed calling for adoption on the list.
*   **Snooze:** Discussed a new capability for snoozing emails, including a new snooze role and property for emails. The question of whether to standardize this in the working group was raised. Concerns regarding potentially subtle differences in everyone's methods were raised.
*   **Archives:** Discussed a container format for handling JMAP data outside of a server, primarily for data portability, migration, and backup purposes. Use cases and potential formats were explored. The discussion suggested it was "underbaked".

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Sharing:** Add more examples to the sharing specification and then the document will be ready to go to the next step. (Action: Neil to add examples)
*   **Sieve:** Move Sieve specification along, assuming no further feedback.
*   **Contacts:** Wait for JS Contact to be finalized before pushing further.
*   **Esme:** Philip Tau will send a reminder to the mailing list regarding header encryption options. Aleksei will update the document and it should be ready for last call next time.
*   **Portability:** Issue a call for adoption on the list for the portability document.
*   **Snooze:** Take discussion to the list to gauge interest in standardization. (Action: Ken to take discussion to the list)
*   **Archives:** Hans Jorg to develop a draft for review based on the feedback received.
*   **Milestones:**
    *   Submit SIV to IESG pushed out to November.
    *   Jmap sharing last call pushed out to November.
    *   Adopt draft for basic migration pushed out to next month for adoption.
    *   SMIMM sender extensions to ISG pushed out to November.
    *   Document with guidance for implementations of iMac servers and proxies pushed out to December. Need to verify what charter says.
    *   G map calendars to ISG pushed out 2 ietfs.
    *   Tasks also held up. push out
    *   Contacts working group last call November
    *   Snooze Call for Adoption October.

## Next Steps

*   Follow up on action items from this meeting.
*   Continue discussions on the mailing list for Snooze, Esme, and Archives.
*   Await finalization of JS Calendar and JS Contact for progression of Calendar and Contacts specifications.
*   Prepare updated drafts for the next IETF meeting based on feedback and decisions made.
*   Issue calls for adoption for Portability and Snooze.
