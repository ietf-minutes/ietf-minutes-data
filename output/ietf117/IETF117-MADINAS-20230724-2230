## Summary
The madinas meeting covered several key topics related to MAC address randomization and privacy, including the current state of a document on the topic, use cases and process statements, updates on IEEE 802.11 related activities (BH/BI), and a presentation on WBA Open Roaming.  A lively discussion followed presentations, particularly concerning Open Roaming and its implications for privacy.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **MAC Address Randomization Document:** The document is nearly ready for working group last call.  Reviews from working group participants, WBA, and OS vendors are desired. MacOS testing was also requested.
*   **Use Cases and Identity Requirements:** The document is almost complete. Discussion centered on the inclusion of HBI and its possible solutions, as well as concerns about the document's focus on Wi-Fi and hotspots, potentially overlooking issues related to Slack, HEP, and BGP.
*   **IEEE 802.11 (BH/BI) Updates:**  Draft 1.0 of the BH amendment has passed the working group letter ballot with strong approval and is considered stable enough for public sharing. It includes two mechanisms: device ID and IRM (Identity Request Mechanism). BI is going beyond MAC address randomization to address privacy around other aspects of the .11 protocol.
*   **WBA Open Roaming:**  The presentation covered the architecture, key technologies (DNS-based peer discovery, PKI), and legal framework of Open Roaming. Concern was raised about the persistent Chargeable User Identity (CUI) across devices and sessions, potentially compromising privacy.
*   **Open Roaming Testing:** Warren presented results from home testing of Open Roaming. It highlighted the persistent CUI issue and potential privacy compromises, especially when sharing email address with Open Roaming partners. It's possible that some of these issues are due to implementer's choices and not strict adherence to standards.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **MAC Address Randomization Document:** Proceed to working group last call after incorporating any feedback from requested reviews.
*   **IEEE 802.11 BH Draft:**  The madinas group to pursue a better liaison relationship with the IEEE group working on this to share drafts free of charge.
* **Interim Meeting:** Schedule an interim meeting in about a month to further discuss the issues raised during the Open Roaming discussion and determine the best way forward.

## Next Steps

*   Send an email to the mailing list with the intention to schedule an interim call in about a month.
*   Continue working on the liaison with IEEE 802.11 to share the BH draft.
*   Investigate the persistent CUI issue in Open Roaming further.
*   Consider additional use cases for the document and to include them in the BCP document.
