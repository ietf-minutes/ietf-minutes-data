# mboned

## Summary

The mboned meeting covered several active working group documents, including telemetry, YANG models, ingress failover, and AMT YANG. Discussions focused on gaining more support for the telemetry draft, updates on YANG models, and presentations on ingress failover and mobile app development for off-net sourcing. A new draft on multicast potential in data centers was also introduced.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Telemetry Draft:** Lack of support during the last call was noted. The need for more reviewers and feedback was emphasized to achieve consensus. Suggestion to include IPPM in the working group last call for better response.
*   **YANG Models:** Updates from Sandy on addressing review comments.
*   **Ingress Failover Draft:** Request for working group last call was made.
*   **AMT YANG Draft:** Presentation by Yisheng, with a request for more reviews and comments.
*   **Mobile App Development for Off-Net Sourcing:** Bradley presented an update on mobile app development, focusing on AMT Gateway implementation and limitations of the Kivy framework. A potential Java rewrite was discussed.
*   **Multicast Potential in Data Centers:** Yisong introduced a new draft about the potential of multicast services in data centers, particularly for AI training, HPC, and storage. Discussions centered on the role of the network layer, benefits of multicast, and suitability of existing protocols.
*   **Lessons Learned Draft:** Mike presented the draft, with discussions on including economic factors, GSA MSDP, and defining the target audience.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Telemetry Draft:** Send a reminder to the IPPM working group about their involvement and issue a working group last call that includes IPPM.
*   **Ingress Failover Draft:** Send a list to request working group last call and request early review from India and Ops Deer.
*   **AMT YANG Draft:** Authors will seek more reviews and comments from the working group.
*    **Mobile App Development for Off-Net Sourcing**: Open Source Android and native java rewrite soon
*   **Lessons Learned Draft:** Expand the scope to include economic factors, GSA MSDP, and AutoRP.

## Next Steps

*   **Telemetry Draft:** Revise and recirculate the draft, incorporating feedback and comments.
*   **YANG Models:** Sandy to proceed with updates based on review comments.
*   **Ingress Failover Draft:** Await comments from the working group after the last call is initiated.
*   **AMT YANG Draft:** Await feedback and comments from the working group.
*   **Mobile App Development for Off-Net Sourcing:** Continue development, address limitations of the Kivy framework, and explore the Java rewrite option.
*   **Multicast Potential in Data Centers:** Seek feedback from interested parties on potential scenarios and requirements for multicast in data centers.
*   **Lessons Learned Draft:** Authors to update the draft with new information and protocols based on feedback received.
