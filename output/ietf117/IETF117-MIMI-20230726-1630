## Summary

This mimi session covered several key topics including a deep dive into Rafael's media delivery service proposal for MLS, discussions surrounding transport draft adoption, updates to the content format draft, and presentations on user discovery. A significant portion of the meeting was dedicated to debating the best path forward for transport and delivery service specifications, balancing immediate interoperability needs with long-term goals of leveraging MLS and minimizing metadata exposure. While there was no immediate consensus to adopt the delivery service draft, there was agreement on the importance of further exploration and potential collaboration between different proposals.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Media Delivery Service (MDS):** Rafael presented a detailed overview of the MDS proposal, emphasizing its role in message ordering, key package availability, and client authentication within MLS groups. The discussion touched on the layering of the protocol stack and the need for a canonical approach to delivery service implementation with MLS. Authentication between client and hub servers and server-to-server using MLS certificates was detailed and debated.
*   **Transport Draft Adoption:** The working group debated whether to adopt the current MDS draft or linearized Matrix proposal. Matthew from Matrix argued for a phased approach to adoption to allow for easier migration paths for gatekeepers who need to comply with the Digital Markets Act (DMA) timelines. Arguments against included the benefits of low crypto stack implementations, strong MLS charter obligations and difficulty accommodating all variant implementations of double ratchet.
*   **Content Format Draft Update:** Rowan provided a brief update on the content format draft and solicited feedback on open issues, including message ID choices and message sorting.
*   **User Discovery:** Jonathan Rosenberg presented the Glados draft, outlining a user discovery architecture designed to map phone numbers to service-specific identifiers, prioritizing ease of use and protection against malicious actors. Giles Hogman presented Google's alternative approach to user discovery, leveraging a DNS-like model with private information retrieval (PIR) to protect user social graphs.
*   **Privacy and Metadata Reduction:** Discussion around metadata reduction, including different techniques for credential storage and privacy. Importance was placed on the need to protect privacy properties due to heightened importance in this space.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **No Adoption Call Today:** After a show of hands using the online tool, the working group did not achieve consensus on adopting the MDS draft today.
*   **Design Team Formation:** There was widespread interest in forming a design team to explore a potential merged solution for transport and delivery service specifications, aiming to combine strengths of the MDs and linearized Matrix proposals. The makeup and goals of this design team needs to be specified.
*   **Interim Meeting Scheduling:** The chairs will work to re-establish a bi-weekly interim meeting schedule, targeting a potential future adoption call at a specific interim once the design team has made progress.
*   **User Discovery Requirements:** Schedule more discussion on user discovery, especially for requirements gathering on privacy properties.

## Next Steps

*   The chairs will discuss the formation of a design team with the authors of the MDS and linearized Matrix proposals.
*   The design team will be tasked with exploring a potential merged solution for transport and delivery service specifications, focusing on balancing immediate interoperability needs with long-term goals of leveraging MLS and minimizing metadata exposure.
*   The authors of the user discovery drafts will share their writeups and presentation materials with the mailing list for further discussion and clarification of requirements.
