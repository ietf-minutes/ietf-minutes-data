# moq Meeting Minutes

## Summary
This moq working group meeting covered a range of topics, including the WARP draft, catalog formats, streaming formats, and prioritization mechanisms. A key discussion point revolved around client capabilities and whether to support "blind" clients that don't know the format they wish to consume. The group also explored various methods for clients to request specific streaming formats when multiple options are available. There were discussions regarding SVC support, catalog design, and web codec usage, as well as implementation strategies and decision-making processes moving forward. The group considered the possibility of an in-person or virtual interim meeting and addressed the process for managing Github PRs.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **WARP Draft Structure:**  Discussion on splitting the monolithic WARP draft into smaller, modular drafts for catalog, packaging (CMF and WebCodex), and text.  Feedback was solicited on this approach.
*   **Client Format Awareness:**  Debate on whether clients should know the format they want before subscribing. Initial consensus leaned towards clients generally knowing the format, but the need for fallback mechanisms was raised.
*   **Catalog of Catalogs:** Explored the concept of a top-level catalog that lists available streaming formats.
*   **Format Requesting:** Four approaches for requesting specific streaming formats were presented: unique catalog names, a catalog of catalogs, a single catalog listing all tracks, and relying on the CMS or application to know the format.
*   **Blind Client Support:** A show of hands indicated mild preference for supporting "blind" clients who don't know what format to request, indicating the group should explore reasonable solutions for both knowing and unknowing clients.
*   **Separate Catalog Draft:** General consensus that the catalog should be a separate draft from specific streaming formats.
*   **SVC Support:** Agreement not to add SVC support to WARP until a real requirement arises. Allowing for extension in future if required.
*   **WebCodex Container Format:** Presentation on a low-overhead container format using WebCodecs, aimed at high efficiency and minimal application overhead.
*    **Object to Quick Streams Mapping:** Discussion of the approach to map media objects into QUIC streams, including the impact of priority characteristics.
*   **Data Gram vs Streams:** Debate on the usage of Datagram and Streams and which would be more beneficial.
*   **Metrics for Evaluation:** Discussion on how to evaluate the quality of implementations to ensure low latency with human perceptual score, Wi-Fi artifacts and audio use case.
*   **Relay Routing:** Debate on if a server should relay announced messages to clients or keep it to itself.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **WARP Draft:**  Break up monolithic WARP draft into smaller, modular drafts.
*   **Client Format Awareness:** Design for both clients who know and don't know the desired format.
*   **Separate Catalog Draft:** The catalog will be a separate draft.
*   **No SVC support in WARP until required:** SVC support will not be added into WARP until real requirements arise.
*   **Github PR process:** PRs that fix design issues will remain open for at least one week.
*   **Investigate terminology updates:** New terminology tag.
*   **Determine Repo for WebCodex:** Move the WebCodex draft into the common repo.
*   **Continue look into In-person/Virtual Interim:** Look into possibilities of a Virtual or in-person interim meeting.
*   **Send prioritization information to the list:** Ali to send information on prioritization to the mailing list.

## Next Steps

*   Post issues requiring feedback to the mailing list for asynchronous discussion.
*   Authors to submit the WebCodex draft to the common repository.
*   Continue planning for an interim meeting (physical or virtual) with potential location in Boston.
*   Implement and test different approaches for mapping media to objects and objects to quick streams.
*   Collect data on metrics for implementations.
