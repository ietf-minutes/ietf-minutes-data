# netconf

## Summary

The netconf working group meeting at IETF 117 covered several key topics including updates on chartered workgroup items, discussions on UDP notification drafts, versioning in Yang notification subscriptions, transactional NETCONF, configuration tracing, and private candidate configurations. Several polls were conducted to gauge working group interest and support for various proposals.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **CTP Node & Client Server Suite:** Status updates were provided, with ongoing efforts to address area director review comments.
*   **UDP Notification Draft:** Discussion on whether to implement UDP server grouping and the potential for separate client/server drafts. The suggestion to reach out to the QUIC working group was raised.
*   **Distributed Notification Draft:** Authors requested feedback on the draft.
*   **Versioning in Yang Notification Subscription:** Updates on addressing issues related to XPAS and multiple Yang models. Discussion regarding error handling for unsupported module revisions and potential integration with Yang packages.
*   **Transactional NETCONF:** Presentation on transaction ID developments and potential for additional optimization mechanisms beyond RESTCONF capabilities. A poll indicated support for allowing variances from RESTCONF for improved efficiency. The potential of using YANG extensions to mark nodes with transaction IDs was discussed.
*   **Configuration Tracing:** Updates on aligning with w3ctraceparent and simplifying the model.
*   **Netconf Private Candidate Configurations:** Review of Netconf and Restconf private candidate solutions, and feedback on conflict resolution. It was agreed to decouple the hello handling issue and create an issue to track it in the NETCONF issue tracker.
*   **Sid Allocation:** Question raised around the management and assignment of SID ranges.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **UDP Notification Draft:** Authors will consider creating separate client/server drafts and collaborate with Kent on this work. They will also reach out to the QUIC working group for input.
*   **Versioning in Yang Notification Subscription:** Addressed error handling for the case where the server doesn't support the resilient specified by the client, this change will be incorporated into the draft. Authors will consider how Yang packages could be incorporated and include text on this in the document.
*   **Transactional NETCONF:** Proceed with specifying the more conservative optimization mechanism for NETCONF.
*   **Netconf Private Candidate Configurations:**  Decouple the hello handling issue from the draft and raise an issue to track it separately in the NETCONF issue tracker.
*   **Sid Allocation:** Kent to send an email to the core working group list, including the NETCONF list, raising the question of SID allocation.

## Next Steps

*   Authors to update their respective drafts based on the feedback received during the meeting.
*   The revised drafts will be discussed on the mailing list.
*   Adoption polls will be rerun on the mailing list for those drafts not yet adopted by the working group.
*   Collaboration among authors of the tracing and transaction ID drafts will continue to ensure alignment.
