## Summary
The Network Management Research Group (NMRG) session at IETF 117 focused on network digital twin (NDT) research. The session included a presentation on data collection requirements and technologies for NDT, followed by an open discussion about defining a research agenda for the group. Key topics included use cases, security and privacy considerations, the layered approach to NDT, and the importance of research questions.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Data Collection Requirements:** Discussed various data collection requirements for building digital twin network systems, including topic-driven collection, diverse tools, lightweight collection, open standardized interfaces, naming conventions, and efficient destination delivery.
*   **Distinguishing Data for NDT vs. AI:** Clarified the distinction between data collected for NDT and general AI applications, emphasizing the comprehensive and real-time nature of NDT data requirements.
*   **Scope of NDT:** Discussed whether the goal is to simply collect network information or to replicate network equipment in the digital twin. Need to clarify level of replication fidelity desired.
*   **Research Challenges:** Identified the need to focus on research challenges rather than engineering tasks in the context of NDT. How can predictive AI methods steer data collection to validate or correct predictions?
*   **Network Telemetry Subscriptions:** Raised the issue that network telemetry subscriptions should be adjusted based on service deployments and aligned with data mesh architecture.
*   **Use Cases:** Emphasized the importance of defining specific use cases for NDT, such as verifying AI solutions, training AI models, and creating sandbox environments.
*   **Security and Privacy:** Addressed security and privacy aspects, including secure access to information, data reliability, and trust issues.
*   **Layered Approach to NDT:** Explored the concept of a layered approach to NDT, considering different network layers (IP, Layer 2, optical) and the need for varying resolutions.
*   **Data Plane Scaling:** Discussed challenges related to data plane scaling in NDT, particularly resource utilization and performance under different loads.
*   **Model Abstraction:** Raised the question of how coarse a model can be while still being useful for specific purposes, balancing abstraction with accuracy.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Action Item:** Collect comments and additional feedback to aggregate them and build a research agenda proposal. (Jean Michel)
*   **Action Item:** Animate definition of concrete definition with text, milestones, something organizing a bit this this approach. (Jean Michel and Jerome)

## Next Steps

*   Formulate good research questions on the topic of NDT and set objectives for proposed work.
*   Articulate the different propositions together to understand relationships between data collection, data generation, and modeling.
*   Concentrate efforts on priority topics/focused areas to generate momentum and progress.
*   Consider the form of results, including Internet drafts, publications, implementation proof-of-concepts, and demos.
*   Open and liaise with other groups and communities inside and outside of the IRTF and IETF.
*   Initiate work on network digital twin research challenges.
*   Concentrate on design guidelines and architecture.
*   Highlight specific use cases.
*   Consider standard implications.
