# OAuth Working Group - Meeting Minutes

## Summary

This meeting covered several key topics related to OAuth security and verifiable credentials. Presentations were given on European Digital Identity Wallets, SD-JWT based Verifiable Credentials, JWT/CWT status lists for token revocation, and attestation-based client authentication. The main themes included improving security and privacy in OAuth flows, especially for public clients, and exploring the use of verifiable credentials in various applications. The meeting concluded with discussions on the scope and future direction of the working group in relation to verifiable credentials.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **European Digital Identity Wallets:** Paolo presented an overview of the European Digital Identity Wallet initiative, highlighting the parallel development of regulations, technical specifications, wallet implementation, and pilot projects. The discussion focused on the need for standardization to ensure interoperability and security.
*   **SD-JWT Based Verifiable Credentials:** Oliver Thiago presented SD-JWT VCs, a profile of SD-JWTs for verifiable credentials. The discussion covered the benefits of SD-JWT VCs for selective disclosure and high-security use cases, as well as the rationale for not basing them on the W3C verifiable credential data model.
*   **JWT/CWT Status Lists:** Tobias Looker presented a draft on JWT and CWT representations of status lists for token revocation. The discussion addressed the scalability, privacy, and caching requirements for such a mechanism. Concerns were raised about the similarities to CRLs and OCSP, as well as the handling of permanently revoked tokens.
*   **Attestation-Based Client Authentication:** Frank showed an attestation based Client Authentication, which would solve missing features to existing methods. Discussion revolved around applying it to public clients for better authentication.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **SD-JWT VC Adoption:** A straw poll indicated support for adopting the SD-JWT VC draft as a working group document.
*   **JWT/CWT Status List Adoption:** There was broad support for this document, with some comments on scalability and privacy considerations. The group agreed to take it to the mailing list for official consideration.
*   **Charter Review:** The working group will discuss a possible rechartering or the creation of a new working group dedicated to verifiable credentials.

## Next Steps

*   The chairs will discuss the possibility of a rechartering for the OAuth working group or the formation of a new working group focused on verifiable credentials with the ADs.
*   The SD-JWT VC and JWT/CWT Status List drafts will be submitted to the mailing list for adoption as working group documents.
*   The working group will schedule a virtual meeting to discuss the charter and future direction.
