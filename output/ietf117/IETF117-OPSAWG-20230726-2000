# opsawg

## Summary

The opsawg meeting covered a wide range of topics including IPFIX extensions, digital mapping, network topology modeling, access control, attachment circuits, incident management, data manifests, geofeed data, green networking metrics, and availability metrics. Several documents were discussed with some nearing last call. The working group also discussed potential adoption of several drafts.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **IPFIX Extensions:** Updates on SRv6 IPFIX and Path State Delay drafts, including implementation status in various tools (Bioshock, PMACCT, XDP/EBPF). Alignment with IPPM performance metrics registry was discussed.
*   **Digital Mapping:** Experiences sharing on modeling network topologies and digital maps using RFC 8345 and augmentations. Discussed limitations of RFC 8345 for digital map modeling, and future work involving Bok methodology and technology-specific augmentations.
*   **Network Topology Modeling:** Addressing limitations in RFC 8345 for representing multipoint and bidirectional topologies. Proposal to enhance the RFC with a point list structure. Efficiency gains were highlighted.
*   **Network Modeling for Carrier Topologies:** Discussion on representing Telefonica's network using IETF topology models for capacity planning and simulation. Use of multiple IETF network instances for different ISIS processes.
*   **Policy-Based Network Access Control:** Updates to the draft focusing on group identity based access control, including new YANG modules for scheduling and user SL extensions. Addition of application as a third endpoint group type was discussed.
*   **Attachment Circuits:** Discussed progress on stabilization of attachment circuit specifications, including alignment with ORAN and 3GPP network slicing.
*   **Incident Management:** Presentation of a draft focusing on incident management for network services, addressing challenges in correlating alarms, KPIs, and other data for troubleshooting.
*   **Data Manifests:** Discussed the purpose of data manifests for understanding collected data, including platform and data collection information. Focus on an issue of reusing device-level modules within network-level modules and a potential "static mount" extension.
*   **Geofeed Data:** An update on geofeed data, discussing implementation by registries and open-source implementation and deployment.
*   **Green Networking Metrics:** Discussion on providing metrics for sustainable networking. Updates included integration of ETSI metrics and a new section on controversies.
*   **Availability Metrics:** Presented on extending IPFIX to export precision availability metric data. This work complements precision availability metrics work being done in IPPM.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Policy-Based Network Access Control:** Call for adoption on the mailing list.
*   **Attachment Circuits:** Formal check for adoption on the list.
*   **Green Networking Metrics:** Bring some of the discussion onto the mailing list.
*   **Digital Map Mailing List:** A mailing list has been set up digital map, hyphen Yang.
*   **Rob Wilton Stepping Down:** Rob Wilton announced he will be stepping down as an opsawg co-chair in March.
*   **Advertise the Network Modeling for Carrier Topologies work:** Advertise this in RTG utWDWG, and NSR, the routing folks are aware that you're doing this.

## Next Steps

*   Authors of various drafts to address comments and continue iterating on the documents.
*   Working group to consider adoption of proposed drafts via mailing list discussions.
*   Further discussion on the digital map work and potential coordination through the newly created mailing list.
*   Address timing issues for Louis and Marisol's presentation by prioritizing them in IETF 118.
