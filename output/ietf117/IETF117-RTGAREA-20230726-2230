## Summary
The Routing Area Open Meeting covered several topics including the state of the area, author list and document quality guidelines, and updates from the CATS (Computing Aware Traffic Steering), MANET (Mobile Ad-hoc Networks), and TBR (Time-Variant Routing) working groups. The meeting emphasized the importance of document quality and clear justifications for author lists exceeding the limit.

## Key Discussion Points
*   **State of the Area:** The SFC working group has closed. BABBLE and ROCK are closing soon with ROCK's remaining work moving to DETNET. No new working groups or BOFs are planned.
*   **Author Lists:** Strict enforcement of the 5-author limit on documents. Justification for exceeding the limit requires specific contributions from each author. Simply wanting to be listed as an author is not sufficient justification.
*   **Document Quality:** Increased scrutiny of document grammar, spelling, and clarity. Documents with insufficient review will be returned to the working group. Tools like Grammarly and ChatGPT are suggested but not mandated. The emphasis is on ensuring the document's meaning is clear and unambiguous to avoid misinterpretations leading to broken implementations. The RFC editor shouldn't be relied upon to fix technical inaccuracies.
*   **CATS Update:** The Computing Aware Traffic Steering (CATS) working group is focusing on defining the problem space and requirements before working on solutions. The goal is to steer traffic based on compute service requirements and network conditions. Collaboration with operational technology vendors (e.g., Schneider Electric, Siemens) is desired.
*   **MANET Update:** The Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (MANET) working group is re-chartering, incorporating BABEL maintenance. They are working on finalizing existing DELAP (Dynamic Link Exchange Protocol) extensions. They are considering new work items, including satellite networking.
*   **TBR Update:** The Time-Variant Routing (TBR) working group is investigating how to plan for scheduled changes in network topology. They are focusing on use cases, requirements, and data models. They are explicitly *not* creating a new routing protocol but aiming to provide schedule information to existing protocols. They discussed the importance of keeping the use-cases and requirements generalized and to avoid being overly focused on satellite networks.

## Decisions and Action Items
*   **Action Item (ADs):** Discuss implementing a process for grammar checking using GitHub or a similar platform to facilitate patch submission.
*   **Action Item (ALL):** Justify authorship of documents in detail.

## Next Steps
*   **MANET:** Initiate re-chartering discussions on the mailing list and schedule an interim meeting.
*   **TBR:** Continue working on merging the requirements documents and YANG models.
*   **CATS:** Continue to gather feedback on problem statements, use cases, and terminology. Explore commonality in metrics with ALTO.
*   **ALL:** ADs will be more strict about document quality and author list justification.
