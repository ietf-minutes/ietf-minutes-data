## Summary
This meeting of the Routing Working Group (rtgwg) covered several topics, including signaling in network computing operations, the Dragonfly topology, a routing framework for LEO mega-constellations, the ROSA problem statement, and the SCION control plane. Discussions revolved around the applicability of existing routing protocols to new network architectures, dynamic load balancing, congestion control, and convergence times.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Signaling in Network Computing Operations:** Clarification of differences between CATS and SINK, control plane considerations, and the potential use of Geneva for data centers. Adrian Farrell suggested coordinating with CATS and ALTO on compute metrics.
*   **Dragonfly Topology:** Issues with dynamic load balancing and lack of standardized congestion definitions. Andrew Olson questioned the differences between Dragonfly and RIFF. The possibility of using traffic engineering was raised.
*   **LEO Mega-Constellation Routing:** Challenges of applying traditional routing protocols to highly dynamic satellite networks. Concerns about the relative movements of satellites within the constellation and its effect on area configurations. Tony Lee suggested considering existing IGP area concepts such as OSPF or IS-IS. Suggestions were made to present this work to the TVR and MANE working groups.
*   **ROSA Problem Statement:** Discussion of how ROSA differs from existing technologies like DNS and CATS. Focus on reducing latency and improving update speeds for service name to IP locator mappings.
*   **SCION Control Plane:** Overview of the SCION architecture and its control plane for secure inter-domain routing. Concern was raised about convergence times.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Signaling in Network Computing Operations:** The authors will consider DNC issues and Geneva examples in future drafts. They will coordinate with CATS and ALTO on compute metrics.
*   **LEO Mega-Constellation Routing:** Authors will consult with MANE and TVR working groups regarding the applicability of this work to their charters. They will also investigate alternative solutions based on OSPF and ISIS, and consider the effects of satellite movements within a constellation.
*   **ROSA Problem Statement:** The authors will add more details on how ROSA relates to CATS in future drafts.

## Next Steps

*   Authors of various drafts to incorporate feedback received during the meeting.
*   Continued discussion on the mailing lists for each topic.
*   Presentations on LEO Mega-Constellation Routing will be scheduled within MANE and TVR WG.
*   Next rtgwg meeting will be on Friday.
