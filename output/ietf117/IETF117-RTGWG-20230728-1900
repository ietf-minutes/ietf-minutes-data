## Summary

This RTGWG meeting covered several important topics, including updates on existing drafts nearing working group last call, discussions on SRv6 protection mechanisms, problem statements for network-to-cloud connectivity and application-aware networking (APN), and new draft proposals for multi-segment SD-WAN and transport-aware mobility. The meeting focused on technical details, addressed comments, and discussed next steps for each topic.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **YANG Data Model for QoS:** The YANG data model for QoS is considered ready for working group last call, pending another review by the YANG doctors, particularly Juergen, due to extensive previous comments.
*   **SRv6 + FEC Protection:** The draft is close to a working group last call but needs further review. The question of merging with an existing SR MPLS draft was raised, but the authors of that draft are not in favor.
*   **SRv6 Protection Considerations:** An informational draft on SRv6 protection strategies was presented. Chairs suggested broadening the author base and gathering input from multiple operators before requesting adoption.
*   **Network to Cloud Problem Statement:** The network-to-cloud problem statement draft is nearing readiness but requires further improvements in readability and clarity. Chairs recognized the significant work done in addressing previous comments.
*   **Multi-Segment SD-WAN:** A new draft proposing the use of Geneve headers to connect multiple SD-WAN segments was presented. Chairs recommended reaching out to security and WEAREA groups for reviews.
*   **Transport Aware Mobility:** An existing draft extending transport-aware mobility from 5G core networks to IP networks was presented. Comments were made regarding the feasibility of mapping UDP source ranges to identifiers in data networks.
*   **APN Problem Statement:** Updates on the APN problem statement were provided. Chairs reiterated that the focus is on packet treatment, not routing decisions, within the network.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **QoS YANG Model:** Request a new YANG doctors review, specifically including Juergen and Upstart, and then proceed with working group last call.
*   **SRv6 + FEC Protection:** Discuss merging with the SR MPLS document again, and address the concerns related to applicability in certain scenarios raised during the session.
*   **SRv6 Protection Considerations:** Solicit input from a broader range of operators on the draft's content and deployment experiences.
*   **Network to Cloud Problem Statement:** Continue to improve the clarity and readability of the draft based on working group feedback.
*   **Multi-Segment SD-WAN:** Reach out to the security and WEAREA working groups for reviews and feedback.
*   **Transport Aware Mobility:** Revise the draft to address the technical feasibility of mapping UDP source ranges to transport network identifiers.

## Next Steps

*   Mailing list discussions for all topics to continue addressing comments and feedback.
*   Presentations in other working groups to gather broader input (e.g., security, WEAREA).
*   Revisions of drafts based on feedback received.
*   Preparation for further discussions at the upcoming meeting in Prague.
