## Summary
This meeting focused primarily on network slicing, covering topics from scalability considerations to data model instantiation and requirements for network topologies. Several drafts were presented and discussed, with calls for adoption and further refinement.

## Key Discussion Points
*   **Scalability Considerations for NRP Slicing:**
    *   Impacts on both distributed and centralized control planes were discussed, including processing burdens and communication channel load.
    *   Different options for NRP data plane identification were compared, including reusing existing fields versus introducing dedicated resource IDs.
    *   Optimization mechanisms for both control and data planes were proposed.
*   **Network Slice Application in 5G:**
    *   Mapping IETF network slice models to 3GPP parameters for 5G scenarios.
    *   Examples of CE-based and P-based slice establishment were presented.
    *   Collaboration with ORAN and alignment with 3GPP were mentioned.
*   **Instantiation of IETF Network Slices:**
    *   Relating customer service models to network models and device configuration for slice realization.
    *   Identifying gaps in model translation and potential areas for standardization.
    *   Discussion on the document's scope and relation to ACTN frameworks.
*   **API Model for Network Slice Services:**
    *   Presentation of a merged API policy and NAPI YANG model.
    *   Support for both configuration and monitoring of network slices.
*   **Network Slice Topology YANG Model:**
    *   Introducing the concept of customized topology specified by the customer.
    *   Differing this concept from abstract topology provided by the provider.
    *   Using customized topology for resource reservation and customer control over connections.
*   **Realization of Composite Network Slices:**
    *   Use cases for multi-domain and hierarchical network slices.
    *   Considerations for resource partitioning, identifiers, and data plane encapsulation.
*   **Attachment Circuit YANG Models:**
    *   Specification of common types, service models, and network models for attachment circuits.
    *   Integration with ORAN and mapping to 3GPP network slice models.
*   **Data Center Aware Topology Model:**
    *   Providing a combined view of networking and compute resources.
    *   Adding compute node to the model and refining data center information.
*   **Network Topology YANG Model Enhancements:**
    *   Improving capabilities for multipoint and bidirectional structures.
    *   Maintaining backward compatibility with existing RFC8345 models.

## Decisions and Action Items
*   **Scalability Considerations for NRP Slicing:** Further discussion on the mailing list to reach consensus on design principles.
*   **Instantiation of IETF Network Slices:** Further discussion on merging content with other documents, or at least changing the title.
*   **API Model for Network Slice Services:** Working group adoption to be polled.
*   **Realization of Composite Network Slices:** Exploration of merging with NSAP and bill as documents.
*   **Network Slice Topology YANG Model:** Take the discussion to the mailing list. Explore alternative solutions using CTM and Virtual Networks to solve requirement.

## Next Steps
*   Continue discussions on the mailing list for each draft.
*   Refine drafts based on feedback from the working group.
*   Explore merging documents to consolidate information and avoid overlap.
*   Conduct polls for adoption of relevant drafts.
