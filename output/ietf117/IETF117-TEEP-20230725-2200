## Summary
The TEep working group meeting covered several key topics, including the status of the protocol specification, implementation updates, and discussions on new draft proposals related to confidential computing use cases. The main focus was on advancing the TEep protocol towards RFC status, resolving remaining issues identified during the working group last call and hackathon, and evaluating the potential adoption of new work items.

## Key Discussion Points
*   **TEep Protocol Specification (Draft 15):**
    *   Discussed changes made since the last IETF meeting, including addressing attestation in both directions (TAM and TEE agent).
    *   Addressed error reporting for query responses, enabling the TEE agent to log or flag errors.
    *   Addressed the use of the cozy key thumbprint specification, and the requirement for normative reference.
*   **Implementation Updates:**
    *   Akita presented updates on the open-source implementation of the TEep protocol, including components for TEE agent and TRF (TEE Runtime Framework).
    *   Highlighted the importance of software supply chain security and provided Docker images and CI scripts.
*   **Confidential Computing Use Case:**
    *   Pengling provided an update on the draft related to confidential computing use cases in the network.
    *   Discussion on packaging models for trusted applications and personalization data.
*   **Distributed Provisioning Relay:**
    *   Pengling presented a new draft on distributed provisioning relay in TEE clusters for big data frameworks.
    *   The draft proposed using a master node as a transport station to relay task information from worker nodes.
*   **Confidential Virtual Machine Provisioning:**
    *   Juan presented a new draft on confidential virtual machine provisioning in cloud environments.
    *   Covered the provisioning process, management of the lifecycle of confidential virtual machines, and message definitions between the cloud user and provider.
    *   Scoping of the draft was discussed relative to the working groups charter and the confidential computing consortiums activities.

## Decisions and Action Items
*   **TEep Protocol Specification:**
    *   Decision to normatively reference the cozy key thumbprint specification to ensure interoperability.
    *   Dave Taylor will post Draft 16 with the updates within 2 days.
    *   Chairs will decide whether to perform one-week working group last call or document check with Dido.
*   **Confidential Computing Use Case:**
    *   Pingling to wait one meeting before proposing working group last call.
*   **Distributed Provisioning Relay:**
    *   Pingling to post the draft to the mailing list to gauge interest and collaboration opportunities.
*   **Confidential Virtual Machine Provisioning:**
    *   John to submit draft to the data tracker.
    *   Participants to review the draft and provide feedback on the mailing list regarding scope and potential adoption.

## Next Steps
*   Authors to incorporate feedback and update drafts.
*   Chairs to evaluate next steps for draft adoption based on WG input.
*   Coordinate potential collaboration on implementation and testing of TEep with suit and rats specifications at the upcoming suit interim in September.
