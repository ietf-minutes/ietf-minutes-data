## Summary

This meeting of the Transport Area Working Group (tsvwg) covered several topics, including updates on existing drafts, a proposal for using GitHub, and presentations on media headway extensions for wireless networks and datagram path MTU discovery for UDP options.  Key discussions focused on the potential use of UDP options, especially regarding encryption and authentication.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **GitHub Adoption:** The chairs proposed using GitHub for draft management, including issue tracking and pull requests. There were no objections to this approach, especially given it was not a forced march.
*   **Media Headway Extensions for Wireless (John):**
    *   The draft proposes a UDP option ("med") to provide information (priority, delay, burst size) to wireless routers for shaping and scheduling encrypted media traffic.
    *   Discussions revolved around the suitability of UDP options versus alternatives like DSCP, IPv6 flow label, and IPv6 hop-by-hop/destination options. Concerns were raised about the performance implications of using UDP options and the mutability of the IPv6 flow label.
    *   It was clarified that using two flow labels defines two distinct flows. Concerns were raised regarding architectural correctness when intermediate nodes inspect data.
    *   Potential for explicit communication between information creator and consumer in 3GPP was raised.
*   **Datagram Path MTU Discovery for UDP Options:**
    *   Status update on the draft, indicating no pending issues.  Progress is dependent on the completion of the UDP options draft.
    *   Discussion arose about the applications of UDP options, particularly those involving moving encrypted information to clear headers. Concerns were raised about the security and architectural implications of such approaches.
    *   A proposed tenant suggested that UDP options should never be attached to encrypted UDP packets. This sparked debate about the potential for creating blocking points to deployment and the ability of networks to modify packets.
    *   The risk of network providers dropping all packets with UDP options in response to denial-of-service attacks was raised.
    *   Discussion on fragmentation, encryption and authentication options. Encryption and Authentication options are currently immature and not getting sufficient reviews.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **GitHub Adoption:** Proceed with setting up GitHub repositories for adopted drafts, focusing on issue tracking and pull request workflows. Editors of existing drafts will be invited to move their drafts to the TSBWG GitHub organization.
*   **Media Headway Extensions for Wireless:**  The presenter will consider the feedback received, especially regarding alternative options and the use of flow labels. Further discussion to occur on the mailing list.
*   **UDP Options:** The chairs will speak to the editor (Joe) and the Area Director about progressing the UDP options draft. Encourage further review and discussion on the mailing list.
*   **UDP Options Encryption and Authentication:** Further discussion on the mailing list to determine if the encryption part should be worked on and how should the authentication part be handled (in a single document or split out)

## Next Steps

*   Implement the GitHub repository approach.
*   Continue discussions on the mailing list regarding the media headway extensions and UDP options drafts.
*   Address open issues related to UDP options encryption and authentication through mailing list discussion and editor coordination.
