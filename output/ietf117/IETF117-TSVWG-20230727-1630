# tsvwg Meeting Minutes

## Summary

This meeting covered a range of topics related to transport protocols, including congestion control, multipath TCP, and security considerations. Key discussions revolved around Careful Resumption, MPDCCP, DTLS and SCTP security, and the use of UDP trailers for traffic prioritization. The group considered various proposals and provided feedback to the authors, with some documents nearing readiness for working group last call.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Careful Resumption:**
    *   Presented updates on the Careful Resumption congestion control algorithm, including NS3 and Linux implementations.
    *   Discussed the trade-offs between pacing strategies and the potential benefits (around 4 RTTs).
    *   Addressed the challenge of determining when to cache BDP and RTT information appropriately for resumption.
    *   The need to decaying information after silence.
    *   The impact of receiver auto-tuning and flow control on jump performance in TCP vs. QUIC.
*   **MPDCCP:**
    *   Discussed optimizations to the handshaking procedure, specifically replacing derived tokens with connection identifiers to avoid collision checks.
    *   Addressed the removal of TA information in the final leg of the initial handshake.
    *   The security principle is not changed because of the Hmac authentication.
*   **DTLS and SCTP Security:**
    *   Explored different approaches for securing SCTP traffic, including DTLS over SCTP and a new "cryptoshank" proposal that protects individual SCTP packets.
    *   Addressed concerns about the availability of DTLS features and implementation challenges.
    *   Discussed the requirements from 3GPP.
    *   Highlighted the importance of rekeying robustness and avoiding data loss during key rotation.
*   **SCTP Checksum Extension:**
    *   Discussed a simple extension to SCTP that allows receivers to signal acceptance of packets with incorrect checksums when an alternate error detection method is in place (e.g., DTLS).
    *   Considered the implications for IPv6 and the need for clear guidance in the document.
    *   The checksome is running over IPv6 you don't have an alternate method.
*   **L4S Experimental Deployment:**
    *   Reported on the ongoing L4S experimental deployment in Comcast's network, including experiences with ECN marking and DSCP leakage.
    *   Shared the high level of customer interest in L4S testing.
    *   The testing running July through September.
*   **Operational Guidance for L4S with Classic ECN:**
    *   Focused on a draft providing guidance on how L4S interacts with classic ECN, primarily on RFC 3168 Bottlenecks.
    *   Desire to keep the guidance draft open to incorporate implementation experiences.
*   **NQB Draft:**
    *   Review and discussion of NQB draft.
    *   Adding more guidance on implementation of a traffic protection function.
    *   Lowered upper bound of application data rates from 1MBps to 500KBps.
*   **UDP Trailers with Encrypted Transports:**
    *   Presented a proposal to use UDP trailers for signaling traffic prioritization information to access networks.
    *   Addressed privacy concerns.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **MPDCCP:** Editors to revise the draft to incorporate changes discussed.
*   **DTLS and SCTP Security:** Hold an interim meeting on September 19th at 1600 CET to further discuss the proposals and requirements. The chairs will prepare chartered items for this work by the next IETF.
*   **SCTP Checksum Extension:** Editors to revise the draft to clarify IPv6 implications and address other minor comments.
*   **NQB Draft:** Editors to address issues and put new revision with new text.

## Next Steps

*   **MPDCCP:** Expect revised document in 1-2 revisions followed by a working group last call.
*   **DTLS and SCTP Security:** Prepare for and participate in the interim meeting.
*   **SCTP Checksum Extension:** Address comments from the list and prepare a new revision for a working group last call.
*   **L4S Experimental Deployment:** Continue testing and analysis, share results at IETF 118 in Prague.
*   **UDP Trailers:** Prepare revisions clarifying security and network architecture concerns.
