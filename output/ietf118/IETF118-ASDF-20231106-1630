## Summary

This meeting focused on the current status of the Semantic Definition Format (SDF) specification, future directions for the working group, and potential rechartering considerations. Discussions centered on extending SDF's capabilities to include location information, addressing non-IP device control, and improving tool support. Two new draft proposals, "Nipsey" (Non-IP Control) and a location format for SDF, were presented.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **SDF Base Specification Status:** The SDF base specification is nearing completion with the anticipated submission to the ISG soon. Recent changes include editorial updates, new terminology ("groupings"), and the reintroduction of short local references within SDF documents.
*   **Future Directions for SDF:** Potential extensions to SDF include:
    *   Mapping files to link SDF specifications to ecosystem-specific information.
    *   Tool support, particularly a compact notation for easier human readability and writeability.
    *   Enhanced linking capabilities between SDF models and data.
*   **Nipsey (Non-IP Control):** A proposal to define APIs for controlling non-IP devices (e.g., BLE, Zigbee) from applications. The goal is to abstract connectivity methods and enable integration with network infrastructure.
*   **Location Information for SDF:** A proposal to add location information to SDF models, enabling the representation of object locations for digital twin applications. The discussion revolved around how to best represent location data within the SDF framework (e.g., as a separate SDF object or as an attribute of an existing SDF thing).
*   **Rechartering Discussion:** The group discussed whether the proposed extensions and new work items fit within the existing charter or require a rechartering. There was general agreement that some extensions, like SDF relations and location information, might already be covered.
*   **Scope Considerations:** Concerns were raised about potentially expanding SDF's scope beyond its original focus on semantic descriptions and into areas already covered by other standards.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **SDF Base Submission:** Kersten will submit the updated SDF base specification to the ISG for publication after addressing minor editorial issues.
*   **Nipsey Side Meeting:** Elliot will email the list to set up a side meeting to further discuss and define the Nipsey proposal and its relationship to SDF.
*   **Charter Update PR:** Francesca to submit PR to update the charter based on discussions.
*   **Review of Drafts:** Volunteers were identified to review the following draft documents:
    *   SDF Compact
    *   Digital Twin
    *   Nipsey
    *   Extended Relation Information for SDF
    *   SDF Type Link

## Next Steps

*   The working group will continue to evaluate the Nipsey and location proposals through email discussion and potentially a side meeting.
*   The chairs will assess whether the proposed extensions require a formal rechartering or can be addressed within the existing charter.
*   Volunteers will review the identified draft documents and provide feedback to the authors.
