## Summary

The calext session covered several topics, including the status of existing drafts (JS Contact, JS Calendar, Subscription Upgrade, iCal Tasks), discussions around HTML descriptions in iCalendar, and future directions for JS Calendar. Decisions were made to return Subscription Upgrade and iCal Tasks to the working group for updates and re-submission. Robert will proceed with Ayanna registration for JS Contact with some discussion needed on the mailing list, and will follow up on schedule id. Ben Bush presented on the issues of HTML descriptions in iCalendar and the use of STYLE-DESCRIPTION.
