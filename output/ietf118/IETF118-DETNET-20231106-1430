# detnet

## Summary

The first detnet session in Prague focused on the working group's status, charter updates, and integration of RAW (Reliable and Available Wireless) technologies into detnet. Discussions covered terminology, multi-domain scenarios, mobility, and edge computing integration. The session also addressed queuing mechanisms for enhanced data planes and the potential for leveraging existing TSN (Time-Sensitive Networking) queuing mechanisms.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Charter Update:** Acknowledged the integration of RAW and made explicit references to wireless support in the charter. Milestones were updated to reflect current work.
*   **Terminology:** Discussed terminology convergence between detnet and RAW, including the use of "recovery graph" and the shift from "PSC" to "PLR."
*   **Cross-Layer Operations:** Addressed concerns about layer violations in the RAW architecture, particularly regarding the interaction between layers for achieving parallel redundancy.
*   **Multi-Domain detnet:** Explored potential gaps and solutions for multi-domain detnet scenarios, emphasizing the need for inter-domain coordination and OEM mechanisms.
*   **Mobility:** Considered the requirements for supporting mobility in detnet, including control plane extensions for proactive movement preparation. Discussed whether mobility is within the scope of detnet or should be handled by Mobile IPv6.
*   **Edge Computing Integration:** Examined how RAW could integrate with edge computing, particularly in the context of the MEC (Multi-access Edge Computing) architecture.
*   **Enhanced Data Plane Queuing:** Reviewed progress on initial evaluations of new proposed scheduling mechanisms and discussed the need for a taxonomy to classify these mechanisms.
*   **Leveraging TSN:** Discussed whether detnet can use existing TSN queuing mechanisms and the problems with that.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Action Item:** Authors of working group documents with AD comments need to address those comments.
*   **Action Item:** Carlos Bernardo to update drafts to align terminology with Pascal's proposed changes, namely, PLR instead of POC. Also to use `detnet e.g. raw network' to describe any raw network.
*   **Action Item:** Working group to investigate benefits of mobility being solved at detnet or the existing Mobile IPv6 level.
*   **Action Item:** Interested parties to develop a draft of the requirements for leveraging existing TSN queuing mechanisms with detnet.

## Next Steps

*   Continue discussions on the mailing list to address open issues.
*   Carlos Bernardo will produce a revision based on the group's comments.
*   Potential interim meeting to wrap up the RAW architecture document.
*   Further discussion on queuing mechanisms at the next session.
