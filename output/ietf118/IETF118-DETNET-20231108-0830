# detnet

## Summary
This detnet session covered updates on the requirements draft, as well as several individual contribution proposals focused on queuing mechanisms and use cases. Discussions centered on scalability, latency guarantees, traffic engineering, and the relationship between different queuing solutions. The session also included a discussion of potential interim meeting to discuss the raw architecture document.

## Key Discussion Points
*   **Requirements Draft:**  Updates were presented, including renaming sections and clarifying requirements related to bandwidth utilization, flow fluctuation, and scalability.  Discussion focused on criteria for evaluating scalable queuing mechanisms.
*   **EDF Queuing:** An Earliest Deadline First (EDF) based queuing mechanism was presented, aiming to improve scalability. Discussion centered on its applicability, particularly regarding different queuing options and competition with other solutions.
*   **Time Slot Queuing (TS):** A TS queuing mechanism was proposed, designed to address scalability issues of existing Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) solutions. Concerns were raised about combining orchestration and hop-by-hop forwarding into a single draft.
*   **Cisco Queuing (CSCQF):**  Updates on the CSCQF mechanism were presented, including time difference compensation and total reserved service rate estimation. Simulation results were shared.
*   **Time Gates and Cyclic Queuing:** The concept of time gates for cyclic queuing was presented as a control plane solution for achieving high utilization and bounded latency. Discussion focused on the role of time gates and how they relate to interleaving flows.
*   **Enhanced Use Cases:** New use cases beyond the existing RFC 8578 were presented, focusing on industrial applications, cloud AR/VR, cloud gaming, and live streaming. Discussion highlighted the need to include references in the document.
*   **Differentiated Data Queues:** A presentation proposed differentiated data queues to support various deterministic services with different SLAs. Concerns were raised about the potential impact on the existing DetNet architecture. There was discussion of traffic engineering and the 3GPP's 5G system architecture as relevant parallels.
*   **Delay Compensation Mechanism:**  A mechanism for delay compensation was introduced, calculating and adjusting for accumulated latency.  The discussion focused on implementation aspects and related control plane requirements.

## Decisions and Action Items
*   **Requirements Draft:** The document will be finalized according to discussions and prepared for a last call request.
*   **Queuing Solutions Open Meeting Series:** The open meeting series will be leveraged to come to convergence on which queuing solutions should be selected by the working group, based on well-defined criteria.
*   **RAW Architecture Interim Meeting:** If progress is not made on the mailing list regarding the RAW architecture document, an interim meeting will be scheduled, potentially the week of January 15th. Lou and Harvard are checking calendar possibilities.
*   **Taxonomy of Queuing Solutions:** David will solicit help on a taxonomy for queuing solutions; a related meeting will be held in the second week of December. The specifics are forthcoming on the mailing list.

## Next Steps
*   Continue discussion and contributions on the mailing list.
*   Prepare a last call request for the Requirements Draft.
*   Organize the Queuing Solutions Open Meeting Series to compare different queuing mechanisms against reference topologies.
*   Determine whether an interim meeting is needed for the RAW architecture document.
*   Review and incorporate feedback into individual contribution drafts.
