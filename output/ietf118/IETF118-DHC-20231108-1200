## Summary

This DHCP working group meeting covered updates on several drafts, including 8415bis, self-generated IPv6 addresses, mobile subscription information, and layer-2 relay agents in cellular fronthauls. Discussions focused on reducing multicast traffic, handling inconsistent server configurations, privacy considerations, and alternative approaches to network configuration.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **8415bis (Update to DHCPv6 Standard):**  In working group last call.  Changes are minor, mainly formatting and removal of deprecated features (IATA support, server unicast).  Important to review carefully for any issues.
*   **Self-Generated IPv6 Addresses:** Addressed concerns about excessive multicast traffic by requiring clients to explicitly request support from servers using an information request message.  Discussion on how to handle inconsistent responses from servers.  Question raised on the host model and responsibility when the host is also a PD.  Another working group last call next week.
*   **Mobile Subscription Information:** Proposed a new DHCP option for sharing mobile subscription info over Wi-Fi.  Discussion on how the host knows when to send the information, privacy concerns, and whether this functionality belongs in a provisioning domain (PVD) instead of DHCP. Alternatives such as 802.11 beacon being discussed.
*   **Layer-2 Relay Agents in Cellular Fronthauls:**  Presented a draft to reopen the possibility of supporting layer-2 relay agents for DHCPv4, similar to DHCPv6. Questioned whether DHCP is the right protocol. The problem is knowing the physical cable. Discussed the feasibility of encapsulating DHCPv4 within DHCPv6 or using other O&M protocols.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **8415bis:** Remain in working group last call until Nov 20th.
*   **Self-Generated IPv6 Addresses:**  Authors to incorporate feedback, especially regarding the "appropriate for the link" text. Next working group last call next week.
*   **Mobile Subscription Information:**  Authors to consider feedback on privacy concerns, the use of provisioning domains (PVD), and potential alternatives using 802.11 beacons.
*   **Layer-2 Relay Agents in Cellular Fronthauls:**  Explore alternative approaches for DHCPv4 configuration information like encapsulating DHCPv4 over v6.

## Next Steps

*   Authors to update drafts based on the meeting feedback.
*   Working Group Last Call for Self-Generated IPv6 Addresses next week.
*   Working Group Last Call for 8415 ends Nov 20th.
*   Further discussion needed on the best venue for the mobile subscription draft and the layer-2 relay agent draft (e.g., 6man).
