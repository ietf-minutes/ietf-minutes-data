## Summary

This meeting covered four presentations. The first presentation discussed R5N, a distributed hash table, and its potential standardization within the IETF. The second presentation introduced a proposal for extending the JSON and CSV formats with named and typed values (NTV). The third presentation advocated for the creation of a state synchronization working group. The last presentation proposed a standardized method for reporting junk mail via DNS records. The meeting also included a brief overview of the upcoming area restructuring and a presentation of a new topic proposal on collective communication.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **R5N Distributed Hash Table:**
    *   Discussion focused on whether a working group would be required and if there's sufficient community interest.
    *   Feedback from routing working group was minimal and improvements have been made since then.
*   **JSON and CSV Extension (NTV):**
    *   Raised concerns about potential overlap with existing solutions like JSON Schema.
    *   Concerns about potential re-invention of wheels.
    *   The Seabor community may not be the right place for this to land
*   **State Synchronization Working Group:**
    *   Several participants expressed skepticism about the possibility of solving a "generalized" state synchronization problem.
    *   Suggestion to approach formal methods research group and to focus on specific applications like HTTP.
    *   The option of an IRTF research group was debated.
*   **Junk Mail Reporting via DNS:**
    *   Proposal to standardize a mechanism for routing junk mail reports via DNS records similar to existing practices with DECOM.
    *   Discussion about potential overlap with existing mechanisms of feedback.
*   **Area Restructuring:**
    *   Overview of art restructuring was presented.
    *   Feedback on area names would be considered.
*   **Collective Communication:**
    *   A collective communication is an interprocess communication model that plays a key role in, high performance computing and, modern Tributed AI training workflows.
    *   Proposed Collective communication optimization as a cross-layer concern, spanning application, transport, and networking areas.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **R5N:** Need to demonstrate a wider community interest before forming a working group. The presenters were encouraged to continue their work and look for adoption.
*   **JSON and CSV Extension (NTV):** There was no clear support for taking this work forward within the IETF. More feedback should be sought from JSON schema.
*   **State Synchronization Working Group:** The meeting participants lean toward the suggestion of an IRTF research group rather than a working group.
*   **Junk Mail Reporting via DNS:** Engage Mogg and get more solid participation. Alexis should try to engage more of Mogg to solidify adoption of a proposed working group. Murray agreed to help, but wants to see commitment.
*   **Collective Communication:** More discussions with other working groups would be needed to explore the proposed implementation.

## Next Steps

*   **R5N:** Seek potential adopters and expand the community.
*   **JSON and CSV Extension (NTV):** Engage with JSON Schema community.
*   **State Synchronization Working Group:** To consider a IRTF research group.
*   **Junk Mail Reporting via DNS:** Alexis to coordinate with Mogg and get more commitment.
*   **Collective Communication:** Presenters will hold a side meeting on Thursday to foster further discussion and contribution.
