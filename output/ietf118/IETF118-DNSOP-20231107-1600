# dnsop

## Summary
This DNSOP meeting covered several topics including hackathon updates, domain control validation, generalized notifications, and DNS solutions for isolated networks. The discussions focused on the technical details of proposed solutions and their applicability to real-world scenarios.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Hackathon Update:** Discussed the "Delek" record as a potential evolution of NS records, focusing on extensibility and security through signing. It aims to improve delegation mechanisms within DNS and allow operators to modify their own parameters.
*   **Domain Control Validation Draft:**  Updates on the domain control validation draft, including tighter requirements for token generation and more detailed treatment of delegated domain control validation. Discussion around domain boundaries, public suffixes and validation record formats.
*   **Generalized Notify:** Presentation on the generalized notify draft, outlining potential solutions for locating where to send notifications or updates. The discussion focused on determining appropriate RR types (new RR type vs. SVCB) and queue names to query.
*   **DNS for Isolated Networks:**  Presentation on a draft addressing DNS resolution in isolated networks, such as space-based networks. Various approaches were discussed including pre-walking names, prefetching zones, and creating special zones.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Domain Control Validation Draft:** Hold off on working group last call until discussions with CAP forum about account identifier implementation are resolved.
*   **Generalized Notify:**  The working group needs to decide whether to use a new record type or SVCB and the queue name to query for.
*   **DNS for Isolated Networks:** Authors to consider incorporating feedback related to real-world operational experience with isolated networks, traffic profiling and alternative solutions.

## Next Steps

*   Follow up on the Hackathon discussion about the "Delek" record design.
*   Continue discussions with the CAP forum regarding the Domain Control Validation draft.
*   Further discuss generalized notifications and resolution of the RR type and queue name questions.
*   Mark to continue working on the "DNS for Isolated Networks" draft, taking into account feedback from the working group.
*   Stuart will present the QD counts document on Friday.
*   Peter Thomas will present on DNS dynamic updates on Friday.
