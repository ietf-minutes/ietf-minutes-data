## Summary

The dnsop working group meeting covered a range of topics including updates on existing drafts, discussions about new proposals related to delegation management, compact denial of existence, SVCB/DANE, and DNS over COAP.  The meeting also addressed the status of several drafts in the editor's queue and those undergoing working group last call.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Draft-ietf-dnsop-failure-to-communicate:** Warren discussed the handling of a draft on signature algorithms that was initially adopted by DNSOP but may now proceed through the IESG due to security area considerations. Concerns about communication failures were raised and addressed.
*   **DNIS SEC Validator Requirements:** The chairs announced the decision to park the document due to a lack of consensus, and the authors' intention to submit it to the independent stream.
*   **Dean insect bootstrapping document:**  Tim emphasized the need for positive support from the working group for the document to proceed, even with existing implementations.
*   **Dynamic Update for Delegation Management (draft-hall-dns-delegation-management):** Johan presented a proposal for using dynamic DNS updates to automate delegation management.  Discussions centered around its potential benefits, security considerations, and applicability to different types of parents (registries vs. others). An interim meeting was suggested to delve deeper into the complexities.
*   **8109bis and DNSSEC Trust Anchor RC updates:** Paul Hoffman provided updates on the status of these drafts, emphasizing the importance of community review and support.  The need to update the trust anchor file and its implications for algorithm rollvers were highlighted.
*   **Compact Denial of Existence (draft-ietf-dnsop-compact-denial-of-existence):** Shuman provided an update on the draft, including a discussion on the usage of NXNAME and ENT pseudo-types, the proper handling of explicit queries for NXNAME, and the potential for restoring the NXDOMAIN RCODE using a new EDNS flag.
*   **SVCB/DANE (draft-ietf-dnsop-svcb-dane):** Ben presented updates to the draft on using DANE with SVCB records, including a discussion of unknown key share attacks and the relationship to the Deleg record discussion.
*   **Proxy Authoritative Server:** Philip presented a draft on a remote authoritative server architecture.
*   **JSON format for DNS messages and records (draft-stastny-dns-json):** Libor presented the drafts covering the JSON format for DNS records and messages.
*   **3901bis:** Momoca asked the group if they agree to update the 3901bis draft, as well as discussed changes to the draft. The group had concerns with the draft.
*   **Domain Registrar Practices:** Scott presented issues associated with delegation titles
