## Summary

This dnssd session at IETF 118 covered several key topics, including updates on SLP and SRP, a discussion of the advertising proxy and its simplification, and updates on TSR and SRP replication. A side meeting focused on document editing was held earlier in the week, informing much of the discussion. Key decisions revolved around adopting a draft to address the multiple query types issue and continuing development of the advertising proxy, TSR, and SRP replication drafts.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **SLP and SRP Status:** Update Lease has been approved by the ESG. SRP is awaiting resolution of discusses.
*   **Advertising Proxy Simplification:** Proposal to simplify the advertising proxy to re-export DNS zones into the ".local" multicast DNS namespace. Conflicts are ignored rather than propagated back. This aims to address issues with transient and spurious conflicts. The retry interval for transient errors needs to be determined.
*   **SRP and DNS Zone Creation:** SRP is to be considered one of many methods for creating a DNS zone. "Zone" doesn't necessarily refer to a global DNS namespace.
*   **PTR Records and Subdomains:** Proposal to advertise the contents of a data set in a subdomain of ".local" but advertise PTR records in ".local" itself. This aims to mitigate name conflicts.
*   **Multiple Query Types:** Current practice of packing two queries (SRV and TXT) into one DNS message causes issues. A draft proposing the use of EDNS0 to request multiple query types with the same name is under consideration for adoption.
*   **TSR and SRP Replication:** Discussed stale data and conflict resolution in the context of TSR. Proposed using a DNS0 option instead of a resource record for TSR to avoid unnecessary probes. Key insight: TSR deals with stale data, not true conflicts.
*   **Avoiding Unnecessary Probes:** Discussed using MDNS to register records as unique to avoid multicast probes, saving airtime.
*   **Partners Discovery Mechanism:** To be able to discover the partners when establishing the session, as well as verify that added other separate mechanism that we exchange this information on the on the established DSO and establish superior session.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Adopt Ray Bellis' draft** proposing the use of EDNS0 to request multiple query types with the same name (QD count = 1). This will be discussed further with the DNSOP working group and the ADs.
    *   **Action Item:** Chairs to coordinate with DNSOP working group and ADs.
*   **Ted Lemmon to re-submit and update the EDNS0 draft.**
    *   **Action Item:** Ted Lemmon to update the draft
*   **Work towards updating and merging related documents** (Advertising Proxy, TSR, SRP Replication).
*   **Seek an additional co-author for the TSR draft.**
    *   **Action Item:** Ted Lemmon
*   **Stewart to review and provide more details on missing details in presentation from San Francisco, on partners discovery mechanism.**
    *   **Action Item:** Stewart

## Next Steps

*   Discuss and confirm adoption of the EDNS0 draft on the dnssd mailing list.
*   Continue development of the Advertising Proxy, TSR, and SRP Replication drafts, incorporating feedback from the working group.
*   Review and solicit feedback on the updated Advertising Proxy draft, focusing on readability and clarity.
*   Coordinate with DNSOP working group and ADs regarding the multiple query types draft.
