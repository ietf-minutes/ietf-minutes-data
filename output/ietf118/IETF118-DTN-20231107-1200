## Summary

This meeting of the Delay and Disruption Tolerant Networking (DTN) working group at IETF 118 covered several key topics, including updates on the DTN Management Architecture (DTNMA) draft, a discussion on Bundle-in-Bundle Encapsulation (Bibe), an update on the APN URI scheme draft, zero configuration for edge nodes, and a broad discussion around application tolerance in delay-tolerant environments, particularly in the context of deep space networking.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **DTNMA Update:** Clarifications and removal of management model details to align with the document's scope as an architecture document. Terminology updates were made to maintain consistency across related DTN network management documents.
*   **Bundle-in-Bundle Encapsulation (Bibe):** A review of the history and applications of Bibe, including its potential for cross-domain security, traffic analysis defense, and quality of service management. The use of Bibe for reliable convergence layer transmission over asymmetric paths was discussed, and its potential relation to Deterministic Networking (DetNet) work was mentioned.
*   **APN URI Scheme Draft:** Removal of governance policy text from the draft to focus on technical aspects, specifically the allocation of the Ayana Allocated identifier registry. A separate governance policy document was suggested.
*   **Zero Configuration for Edge Nodes:** Use of existing protocols and mechanisms, especially DNSSD, to simplify the bootstrapping of lightweight single application BP edge nodes, to lower the barrier to entry for prototyping and interoperability testing.
*   **Application Tolerance in DTNs:** A discussion of the challenges intolerant applications face in delay-tolerant environments. Intermittency vs. latency, transport security vs. communication security, and resource constraints in deep space were highlighted. The potential for an informational document on application tolerance was raised.
*   **IP vs BP in Deep Space:** A broad discussion of the applicability of IP (particularly with QUIC) versus Bundle Protocol (BP) in deep space.  IP works.  IP software and hardware exists.  BP does not equal IP, different purposes. Both can exist and potentially benefit each other, specifically using QUIC as a convergence layer for BP. The need to define limits of IP, standardize the BP conversion layer on QUIC, and one mailing list to avoid confusion was raised.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Action Item:** Put the updated APN URI scheme draft into working group last call.
*   **Action Item:** Brian Sivos to take feedback from session, particularly that related to routing between edge nodes and some thoughts on requirements.
*   **Decision:** Pursue a final working group last call for the APN URI Scheme Draft.

## Next Steps

*   Brian Sivos to address comments on the lightweight bundle protocol Edgenode zero configuration and zero state personal draft.
*   Consider drafting an informational document on what a tolerant application is and the considerations for running applications in a DTN environment.
*   Continue the exploration of QUIC and IP for near-space applications and standardization of a BP convergence layer on QUIC.
*   Determine a single mailing list for discussing both deep space IP-related issues and general DTN topics.
