# Hackathon Results Presentations

## Summary

This session covered presentations from various teams participating in the IETF Hackathon. The presentations highlighted the projects undertaken, technical challenges encountered, and results achieved during the event. Topics ranged from routing protocols and security enhancements to network management and new protocol implementations.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Riot on CoAP API:** Developed a high-level CoAP API for the RIOT operating system, aiming for ease of use and broad transport protocol support (UDP, TCP using gcoap and libcoap respectively). Need to focus more on the security aspects.
*   **MSRC Comprehensive Evaluation:** Implemented and evaluated several MSRC (Multi-Source Routing and Coding) solutions on hardware and software levels, comparing performance of different schemes.
*   **Dynamic Network Routing:** Simulated and evaluated routing protocols in a dynamic satellite network environment, finding that packet loss is a common problem. Link attributes of the community often improve the network performance.
*   **63 ADHOC Network:** Implemented a tree-structured IPv6 routing network using the 63 prefix, verified via phone call. Ultra-low latency not yet achieved.
*   **ASPA Ecoton Project:** Implemented ASPA verification in RTRlab (a library for RTR communication), but struggled with the imprecise description of the verification algorithm in the drafts.
*   **Rift Interoperability Testing:** Conducted interoperability tests between Juniper, open source, and ZTE implementations of the RIFT routing protocol using the newest structure. Limited by darker issues.
*   **ROCA Encryption Algorithm:** Included the ROCA encryption algorithm in the quick TLS and evaluated its performance.
*   **Scion Deployment Guide:** Built a deployment guide for Scion in private environments (Equinix Metal, AWS) to facilitate security testing, finding undocumented shortcuts.
*   **Self Open Playground Hackathon Project:** Emulated various sound scenarios based on cell OP and evaluated their differences. Metric routing exhibited low data frame forwarding performance.
*   **Scion RPC Stack Improvement:** Built an RPC stack using HTTP/3 directly over QUIC/Scion, based on connect.
*   **QUIC Additional Addresses:** Implemented and tested QUIC additional addresses extensions with 5 open-source implementations.
*   **Network Anomaly Semantics:** Finalized a YANG model for network anomaly semantics and implemented a proof-of-concept tool (antagonist) for annotating time-series data.
*   **Island P:** Tested basic connectivity of Island P (Identifier/Locator Network Protocol) across IPv6, including with ephemeral node identifiers.
*   **Measuring Odiness Transparent Forwarders:** Extended a tool to measure transparent forwarders in the open DNS infrastructure to support DNS over TCP.
*   **Open Roaming Medina Analysis:** Analyzed privacy information leakage in open roaming federations. Different IDPs showed different implementations.
*   **Ultra Low Latency Crypto:** Added the Ariane cryptographic scheme to boringSSL for use with WebRTC.
*   **TEPSI Quick Deep Space Transport:**  Adapting quick for deep space transport using TAPS API, supporting extremely long delays.
*   **Ticozy:** Added non AED and Chune mode (AES counter mode and AES CBC modes) for it.
*   **MTL Mode:** MTL mode is a method we are working on for post quantum signatures to reduce the impact on the underlying protocol.
*   **IPv6 only on Linux:** Implemented a daemon in Python which listens to pref 64 option in route advertisements, which can configure local translator.
*   **PQ in X.509:** Worked on post-quantum cryptography (PQC) integration in X.509 certificates. New draft released for testing.
*   **De DNS to Compression:** Discussed ways to evolve DNS, including a new delegation type.
*   **L4S/ECN Interop Testing:** Running interop testing for L4S and ECN and testing to see how it works.
*   **Resumable Uploads Over HTTP:** Developed plugins for existing HTTP proxies to handle resumable uploads and created a tool to test server implementations.
*   **Yang Division Label Presentation:** Discussed module versioning and semantic versioning for young models.
*   **Sustainable Insights:** Mapping from young to the time series database formats.
*   **IPv6 Only Resolver Adobe:** Set up a public resolver using NAT64 and DNS64 for IPv6-only clients.
*   **NTP Hackathon:** Get the NTP V draft support in a full, NTP implementation. So at basically, of the big four ones we wanted to also get it working with nts.1 tried before.
*   **On Path Telemetry Presentation:** Implementation of IP fix on path delay.
*   **IPmon Hackathon Project:** try to, set up simulation environment for 5 g based thrown or, urban air mobility communication system for safe and secure flight.
*   **Intent waste the management:** C and C And C That's management.
*   **LLTCP:** Long lived C2P, DNS monitoring presentations.
*   **Effect of Commitments Based on Proof of Transit:** design and implement in the new a new so what is a proof of transit mechanism.
*   **Hackathon tie dye:** open source implementation of tie dye, which was released just a few weeks ago.
*   **PQ ETH:**  on making a postgraduate version of encrypt clients low.
*   **Core ace lake table Kosie:** Cozy, implementation in Rust presentation.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Action Item:** Continue the discussion on privacy issues within the Open Roaming federation in Medina.
*   **Action Item:** The ASPA team will continue discussions regarding the interpretation of the verification algorithm in the ASPA draft.
*   **Action Item:** Work on test and documentation for Ticozy, for the next alpha 2 release.
*   **Action Item:** MTL Mode team to consider different cryptographic libraries and language bindings. Create a draft for the how to use it with DNS sec.
*   **Action Item:** Convince tools like network manager or sustained network d to implement IP6 only on Linux.
*   **Action Item:** DNS developers to make a prototype to evaluate ideas and solve limitations.

## Next Steps

*   Continue testing and development efforts based on the findings of the hackathon.
*   Further refine drafts and implementations based on feedback received.
*   Present results and findings to relevant working groups within the IETF.
*   Attend the hack demo happy hour for demonstrations.
