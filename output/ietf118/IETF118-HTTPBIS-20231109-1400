# httpbis

## Summary

This httpbis meeting covered several active drafts and proposals. Key topics included Compression Dictionary Transport, Cookies, Unprompted Authentication, Query Method, Retrofit Structured Fields, Cash Groups, and the Qpex Static Table version TLS extension. The meeting focused on discussing ongoing issues, potential solutions, and future directions for each topic.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Compression Dictionary Transport:**
    *   Discussion on replacing the custom wildcard implementation with URL pattern.
    *   Consideration of adding "match desk" to match on fetch destination.
    *   Proposal to reduce the default TTL to 7 days.
    *   Discussion on sorting the accepting coding header and requiring dictionary versions to include support for non-dictionary versions.
    *   Adding dictionary source URL and eTag for the dictionary.
*   **Cookies:**
    *   Discussion on the SameSite cookies and redirects issue and the ongoing experiment in Chrome.
    *   Consideration of potentially removing the SameSite redirect requirement for now to allow the spec to progress.
*   **Unprompted Authentication (Signature HTQ Authentication Scheme):**
    *   Decision to keep the current design and not switch to exported authenticators.
    *   Discussion on the exporter context parameters.
    *   Status of implementation and future steps.
*   **Query Method:**
    *   Call for design team participants to speed up progress on the open issues.
*   **Retrofit Structured Fields:**
    *   Announcement of another working group last call for a week to confirm non-ASCII string formats.
*   **Cash Groups:**
    *   Brief overview of the new cash control mechanism to group together responses.
*   **Qpex Static Table version TLS extension:**
    *   Proposal to define the qpact static table in a registry.
    *   Enable new headers to get added to the table.
    *   Negotiation scheme using a TLS extension.
    *   Discussion on whether this should be a TLS extension or use ALPS.
    *   The need for performance data and governance on selecting headers was strongly highlighted.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Compression Dictionary Transport:**  Patrick to consider feedback regarding URL and eTag.
*   **Cookies:**  Decision to remove the SameSite redirect requirement from the spec if a solution cannot be found soon.
*   **Query Method:** Form a design team and coordinate with Julian.
*   **Retrofit Structured Fields:** Kick off another short working group last call.
*   **Qpex Static Table version TLS extension:** Collect performance data and consider governance on selecting headers.

## Next Steps

*   **Compression Dictionary Transport:** Continue discussion and refinement of the draft.
*   **Cookies:**  Await results of Chrome experiment and decide on the SameSite redirect requirement.
*   **Unprompted Authentication:** Update implementation and continue interoperability testing.
*   **Query Method:** Form the design team and schedule a Telco.
*   **Retrofit Structured Fields:** Kick off the working group last call.
*   **Cash Groups:**  Encourage review and contributions to the spec.
*   **Qpex Static Table version TLS extension:** Collect performance data and further explore the design options.
