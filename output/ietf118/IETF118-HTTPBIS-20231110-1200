# httpbis

## Summary

This httpbis meeting covered a variety of topics, including updates on active drafts for resumable uploads and connect TCP, as well as discussions on several proposals: security considerations for optimistic HTTP upgrade, reverse HTTP transport, secondary cert authentication of servers, braid, and per-resource event protocol.  The meeting focused on technical details, implementation considerations, and potential next steps for each of these areas.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Resumable Uploads:**
    *   Discussion around the appropriate media type for PATCH requests used in resumable uploads, with options including `application/octet-stream`, a new media type like `application/offset+octet-stream`, and potentially leveraging "partial put" semantics.
    *   Debate regarding how to handle responses in the context of transparently upgrading regular uploads to resumable uploads, particularly concerning lost responses and error codes.
    *   Review of a proposal to use informational responses (104) to carry upload progress, including discussion on whether location header should be mandatory.
    *   Interoperability with HTTP Digest and whether the draft should specify behavior when checksums don't match for interrupted PATCH requests.
*   **Connect TCP:**
    *   Discussion of adding a default template to Connect TCP, mirroring the approach in Connect UDP and Connect IP.
    *   Consideration of the document's relationship with optimistic upgrade, particularly whether that work should be adopted before last call on Connect TCP.
    *   Motivation of the work. Lack of host name specification in legacy Connect.
*   **Security Considerations for Optimistic HTTP Upgrade:**
    *   Discussion around the security implications of optimistic transmission in conjunction with HTTP upgrade.
    *   Guidance for creating new upgrade tokens, particularly concerning the interaction of attacker-controlled data and the upgrade payload.
    *   The existing issue with Connect UDP
*   **Reverse HTTP Transport:**
    *   Exploration of reverse HTTP transport, where the origin server acts as a transport client.
    *   Discussion of potential standardization of this pattern to address limitations with proprietary implementations.
    *   Concerns about role reversal and the interaction with H3.
*   **Secondary Cert Authentication of Servers:**
    *   Discussion about scope and the use cases of secondary server certificates.
*   **Per Resource Event Protocol (PREP):**
    *   Overview of PREP and its simple multi-part message format.
    *   The desire for event format negotiation.
    *   Discussion on the benefits of PREP, in constrast to other push protocols.
*   **Braid:**
    *   This proposal to change the core scope of HTTP to also include synchronization.
    *   Discussion of the concept of state synchronization in HTTP and the Braid HTTP draft.
    *   Discussion to the adoption of subscription model and CRDT.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Security Considerations for Optimistic HTTP Upgrade:** The working group showed support for the adoption of the draft. A call for adoption will be made on the mailing list.
*   **Connect TCP:** Take the discussion to the issue tracker to discuss template default values.
*   **Secondary Cert Authentication of Servers:** Take the discussion to the list to discuss implementation interest.

## Next Steps

*   **Resumable Uploads:** Continue discussion on open issues, particularly those related to media types, response handling, and checksum verification.
*   **Connect TCP:** Take the discussion on the pros and cons of a well-known URI Template to the github issue.
*   **Security Considerations for Optimistic HTTP Upgrade:** A formal call for adoption will be sent to the mailing list.
*   **Reverse HTTP Transport:** Continue discussion on the mailing list regarding the direction and scope of the proposal, particularly considering the feedback regarding alternative approaches and existing solutions.
*   **Secondary Cert Authentication of Servers:** Take the discussion to the mailing list to discuss implementation interest, next a call for adoption.
*   **Per Resource Event Protocol (PREP) and Braid:** Initiate discussions on the mailing list to explore the individual component standards to support subscriptions, HTTP patch and CRDT and if the effort can be decomposed.
