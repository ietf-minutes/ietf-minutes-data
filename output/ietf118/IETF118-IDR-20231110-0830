## Summary

This IDR session at IETF 118 covered a range of topics, including BGP Multi Next Hop attribute, advertising SaaS performance metrics using BGP, BGP extensions for 5G edge service metadata, computing resource notification domains in the network, addressing deficiencies in RT constraints for hierarchical route reflection, multiprotocol extensions for IPv4/IPv6 coexistence, IPv4 islands over an IPv6 core (4PE), generic metric extensions, and vendor implementation reports for BGP BFD Strict Mode. A recurring theme was the potential overloading of BGP with dynamic information and the need for careful consideration of the implications.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **BGP Multi Next Hop Attribute:**
    *   Discussion on whether capability negotiation is required. Concerns about operational complexity with capability negotiation.
    *   Importance of analyzing scoping, attribute escape, and consistent incremental deployment.
    *   Need for clarity on how the attribute behaves on a hop-by-hop basis, particularly when next hops are unresolvable.
    *   Consistency with other mechanisms for signaling labels, such as Prefix SID and BGP-LU.
*   **Advertising SaaS Performance Metrics Using BGP:**
    *   Debate on whether BGP is the appropriate protocol for carrying dynamic performance metrics due to potential BGP update churn.
    *   Consideration of whether this work overlaps with the CATS working group.
    *   General concern about injecting dynamic information into BGP and the implications for BGP convergence properties.
    *   Potential need for a more generic mechanism for passing compute metrics.
*   **BGP Extensions for 5G Edge Service Metadata:**
    *   Concerns regarding the stability of the specification before allocating a path attribute code point. Use of experimental code points was suggested for implementations.
    *   Need to use community 7454.
*   **Computing Resource Notification Domains in the Network:**
    *   Discussion on how this work relates to the CATS working group and the scope of its charter.
    *   Questioning whether existing BGPLS and community mechanisms can address the problem.
    *   General concerns about the complexity being added to BGP.
*   **Addressing Deficiencies in RT Constraints for Hierarchical Route Reflection:**
    *   Existing implementations address this issue with mechanisms such as rewriting originator IDs and/or class list IDs.
    *   Discussions around AS loop prevention compared to other loop detection mechanisms.
*   **Multiprotocol Extensions for IPv4/IPv6 Coexistence:**
    *   Discussion regarding the need for a mapping solution when there exist encapsulation-based solutions.
*   **IPv4 Islands over an IPv6 Core (4PE):**
    *   No specific discussion points.
*   **Generic Metric Extensions:**
    *   Discussion on different vendor implementations of the AGP TLV.
    *   Concern on whether the continuity bit can address the issues of having differing implementations, or if a new AGB V2 needs to be defined.
*   **Vendor Implementation Report for BGP BFD Strict Mode:**
    *   Discussion around the behavior when remote admin enabled/disable.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **BGP Multi Next Hop Attribute:**  Working group adoption call will be started next week.
*   **Advertising SaaS Performance Metrics Using BGP & Computing Resource Notification Domains in the Network:** Authors to socialize their work within the CATS working group.
*   **BGP Extensions for 5G Edge Service Metadata:** Author to change this draft to be in experimental status and use an experimental code point.
*   **Addressing Deficiencies in RT Constraints for Hierarchical Route Reflection:** Authors to review the existing and new proposals to work on a converged solution.
*   **Generic Metric Extensions:** Louis to take his question to the mailing list.

## Next Steps

*   Continue discussions on the mailing list for all topics.
*   Authors to incorporate feedback from the working group into their drafts.
*   Authors to socialize their work with other relevant working groups, particularly CATS.
*   Working group chairs and ADs to review the scope of the CATS charter.
