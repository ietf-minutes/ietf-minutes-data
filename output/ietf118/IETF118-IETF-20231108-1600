# IETF 118 Plenary

## Summary

The IETF 118 Plenary covered a range of topics, including meeting statistics, ISG statements, area mergers, hackathon updates, IAB activities, IETF Trust restructuring, and a memorial for a deceased community member. Discussions focused on improving meeting experiences, addressing diversity concerns, and ensuring financial stability. The plenary also featured open mic sessions for community feedback and questions directed to the IAB, LLC, and ISG.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Meeting Statistics:**  IETF 118 saw high on-site and remote participation numbers, marking it as the largest meeting since COVID.
*   **ISG Statements:** Updates were provided on ISG statements related to in-person/online meetings, support documents, and the merger of the Art and Transport areas.
*   **Area Merger (Art/Transport):** The ISG is merging web-related parts of the Art area with Internet Transport parts of the Transport area into a new "Width" area. The Transport area will close. This is planned to occur before the Brisbane meeting.
*   **Friday Experiment:** Friday afternoon sessions will continue in Brisbane, acknowledging session time pressure and needing more data before a final decision.
*   **Keep Ukraine Connected:** An initiative to provide networking equipment to Ukraine was highlighted, with a call for further support.
*   **IAB Workshop:** A workshop in January will focus on barriers to Internet access services, seeking position papers from the community.
*   **IETF Trust Restructuring:** The IETF Trust is restructuring into a Delaware non-profit corporation.  Asset transfer is in progress, and the current Virginia Trust will shut down by the end of 2024. New bylaws are proposed with a 60-day notice period for changes.
*   **Meeting Fees/Waivers:** Concerns raised about high meeting fees and accessibility. Discussions centered on improving the fee waiver process, exploring alternative funding sources, and balancing budget requirements.
*   **Diversity and Inclusion:** The LLC board acknowledged the importance of improving diversity and inclusion within the IETF community and is actively exploring strategies.
*   **Lunchtime Meetings**: Concerns were raised about holding normative (e.g., those that may produce RFCs) meetings during lunch and interfering with the hallway track.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Area Merger:** The ISG will proceed with merging the Art and Transport areas into the Width area before the Brisbane meeting.
*   **Friday Experiment:** Friday afternoon sessions will be scheduled for the Brisbane meeting.
*   **Meeting Fees/Waivers:** The LLC Board will discuss the meeting fee structure and potential improvements at their next meeting.

## Next Steps

*   Colin to discuss improving travel grant program process with Alexa.
*   ISG to consider creating a mailing list for side meeting conveners.
*   Jay will provide percentages for how funds are allocated.
