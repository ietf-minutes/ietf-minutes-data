## Summary

The LAMPS working group meeting covered a range of topics including updates on documents progressing through the IESG, discussion of KEM integration in CMS and CMP, and the AES CBC/GCM attack mitigation proposal. Several documents are nearing working group last call. A new draft regarding signaling of clear text copies in encrypted email messages was presented, and the working group will consider adoption.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **KEMRI Document (draft-ietf-lamps-cms-kemri):** Currently in IESG state. External party raised concerns about inverse CBC decryption Oracle attack. Question raised about whether to include content encryption algorithm in CMS. Discussed CMS never doing HBKE.
*   **CMP DiscNet (draft-ietf-lamps-cmp-algorithms & draft-ietf-lamps-cmp-updates):** Incorporating RFC 9480 material as requested by the IESG. Need more review on KEM integration into CMP. Seeking feedback on content for KEM other info.
*   **PKS P12 PBES2 (draft-ietf-lamps-pkcs12-pbmac-08):** In working group last call. Resolved issues with DMP string encoding for password. Need to check ASN.1.
*   **CSR Attestation (draft-ietf-lamps-csr-attestation):** Aiming to integrate hardware key attestation into CSRs. Discussed changes to ASN.1 structure (evidence bundles), addressing CRMF incompatibility, and handling freshness/nonces in attestations.
*   **EST/CMP Nonce (draft-hietala-lamps-est-cmp-nonce):** Presentation on how to introduce nonces to enrollment protocols like EST and CMP to provide freshness for attestations.
*   **OCSP (draft-zhou-lamps-ocsp-ecdsa):** Ready for working group last call.
*   **Kyber Certs (draft-brown-lamps-kyber-certs):** Update on draft. Discussed potential name change to ML-KEM and private key format. Will include example certificates with a warning about it using old version.
*   **CMS Kyber (draft-jivsov-lamps-cms-kem):** Editorial changes, adding references to other drafts. Discussed renaming to ML-KEM and algorithm configurations. AES192 to be updated to AES256.
*   **End-to-End Mail Guidance (draft-richardson-lamps-e2e-mail-guidance):** Discussed scenarios where a single message might be sent encrypted to some recipients and in clear text to others, and how mail user agents should handle this.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Action Item:** Note taker to initiate working group last call for the policy graph document (draft-ietf-lamps-cert-policy-data).
*   **Action Item:** Working group to consider adoption of the end-to-end mail guidance document (draft-richardson-lamps-e2e-mail-guidance).
*   **Action Item:** Note taker to initiate working group call for adoption for the end-to-end mail guidance document.

## Next Steps

*   Address open issues and comments raised for each document.
*   Continue discussion on the mailing list for key design choices.
*   Advance documents towards working group last call where applicable.
