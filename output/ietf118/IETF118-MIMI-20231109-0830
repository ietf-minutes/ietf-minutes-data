## Summary

This meeting covered the Mimi architecture, content format, and protocol design. Key discussions revolved around terminology consistency, message ID handling, external content security, message ordering, and the state management of users in rooms, particularly concerning banning and removals. The design team provided updates on document structure and proposed next steps, including potential adoption calls.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Terminology:** Inconsistencies across documents were noted, and a unified terminology section was requested, preferably in the architecture document.
*   **Content Format - External Content:** Extensive discussion regarding the handling of external content (attachments) including security implications of web bugs, potential approaches like using the hub or local provider for content delivery, quota management, and privacy considerations.
*   **Content Format - Message IDs:** Debate on the necessity of message IDs versus relying on ciphertext hashes. Concerns were raised about handling duplicate messages and maintaining data integrity.
*   **Content Format - Message Ordering:** User experience requirements for consistent message ordering across clients were discussed, including potential challenges and recommendations for implementation. The team acknowledged complexities involved in server-side ordering.
*   **Mimi Protocol: Protocol vs. Delivery Service Separation:** Discussion on keeping the Mimi Protocol separate from the Delivery Service document. This was due to potential re-use of the Delivery Service in other contexts and engineering considerations regarding the interface between crypto and non-crypto elements.
*   **Mimi Protocol: User State Management:** Discrepancies emerged in the understanding of how user state is managed during removal processes (e.g., banning), specifically the order in which the MLS group, participant list, and authorization policies are updated. Clarification was provided, but inconsistencies in the draft were identified. A state with limited capabilities between removal from MLS and removing the participant were also proposed.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Content Format - External Content Security:** Create an issue to address the vulnerability where anyone with the key can generate a new, valid encryption.
*   **Mimi Protocol:** Correct the slide about adding proposals because right now it states you immediately get added to the party. That point only applies when someone is added and not when they are removed.

## Next Steps

*   The design team will revise the documents based on the feedback received.
*   Address the comments made in the Zulip chat.
*   The working group will use the mailing list or github to continue discussion on external content delivery.
*   Consider an interim meeting the first week of December, document revisions available a week in advance, for further discussion and feedback.
*   The working group will continue to work toward a decision about whether it wants to be as much technical content to a adoption decision.
