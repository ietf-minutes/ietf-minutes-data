## Summary
This meeting focused on open issues within the mimi protocol and explored different approaches to user discovery. Discussions included tracking arbitrary state, fan-out mechanisms, and privacy considerations for service reachability. There was significant debate regarding the requirements for user discovery, particularly concerning the balance between privacy and service reachability. Several action items were identified, including clarifying authentication mechanisms and updating the requirements document.

## Key Discussion Points
*   **Tracking Arbitrary State:**
    *   The need to carry informational state (e.g., room name, topic) within the protocol was discussed.
    *   A proposal to implement an "M room state" event was introduced, including considerations for encryption and standardized fields.
    *   Encryption was debated, along with concerns of how to maintain key rotation with the MLS group.

*   **Fan-out and Routing:**
    *   The group discussed how key packages should be routed, specifically regarding whether they should always go through the hub.
    *   Concerns were raised about potential connectivity issues if keys are fetched directly from the source, especially in decentralized messaging architectures.

*   **Authentication Mechanism for Key Packages:**
    *   Discussion on whether or not a fetching client should be authenticated to request key packages, and how to achieve this.

*   **Discovery Framing:**
    *   The problem of user discovery was framed as mapping service specific identifiers (SSIs) to service independent identifiers (SIIs).
    *   Discussion evolved into separating user discovery into authentication and distribution sub-problems, and their different threat models.

*   **Privacy Considerations for Service Reachability:**
    *   Whether or not to protect against someone using an SII to enumerate account SSI's on a particular service.
    *   Privacy needs of protecting data from the discovery provider, as well as a general anti-enumeration or rate limiting.
    *   Debate on hiding SIIs from discovery providers and recipients, balancing privacy with anti-spam measures.

*   **Identifier Strategies**
    *   Consideration of new, Mimi-specific identifiers for enhanced control.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Authentication Mechanism for Key Packages:** Someone will write a clear explanation of the authentication problem on the mailing list.

*   **Requirements Document:** Jonathan Rosenberg and John Peterson will continue to update the requirements document with insights from the meeting, clarifying the scope and goals of user discovery.

## Next Steps

*   Working group members should review the existing Mimi protocol draft and comment on GitHub issues, particularly those considered blockers to adoption.
*   The design team will process GitHub issues and make changes, potentially publishing a version prior to the adoption call.
*   Continue discussion of privacy and security requirements for user discovery on the mailing list.
