# moq

## Summary

This moq working group meeting covered several key topics, including interop updates, a summary of recent draft changes, object model to transport mapping, and various subscription-related issues. The main focus was on resolving the mapping of object model to transport and addressing concerns around subscription management.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Interop Readout:** Ongoing interop efforts, hack-a-thon planned for tomorrow. Limited interop between different implementations so far.
*   **Moku Changes Since 00:** Clarifications on version negotiation, splitting of "Set up," editorial fixes, addition of subscribe hints and reset messages. No direct TCP fallback.
*   **Object Model to Transport:**
    *   Discussion on implicit vs. explicit signaling for relay forwarding.
    *   Implicit signaling: Relay forwards objects in the same way they were received.
    *   Explicit signaling: moq messages carry information about how the relay should forward objects.
    *   Proposal to add explicit signaling to the draft for implementation experience.
    *   Consensus on explicit signal, however that if they don't match, consider it a bug.
*   **Subscription Issues:**
    *   **Track Names and Namespaces:** Agreement that there should be no restrictions on track names at the transport layer. Binary comparison to be used. Any escaping must occur before the comparison.
    *   **Multiple Subscriptions:** Agreement to allow multiple subscriptions to the same track.
    *   **Overlapping Subscriptions:** Initial proposal and then Ted’s final solution.
    *   **Updating Subscriptions:** Consensus to include an "update subscribe" message in the next draft.
    *   **Resource Limits:** Discussion on setting limits on the number of subscriptions. Aim to protect memory.
    *   **Track ID Renaming:** Discussion if Track ID (compressing name) and Subscriber ID (for subscription transactions) should be related.
        * Conclusion to keep track ID and subscriber ID separate

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Object Model to Transport:**
    *   Add explicit signaling to the draft.
    *   A small group to write a PR to add a signal.
*   **Track Names and Namespaces:** Editorial PR to specify no transport restrictions.
*   **Multiple Subscriptions:** Allow.
*   **Overlapping Subscriptions:** Ted’s solution will prevail to start. Get what the client asked for, even if duplicated. Let client decide to close the request to save resources
*   **Updating Subscriptions:** Include "update subscribe" message in the next draft iteration.
*   **Resource Limits:** Implement limits on the numbers of connections allowed.
*   **Track ID Renaming:** Leave track ID untouched.

## Next Steps

*   Interop: Proceed with the hack-a-thon and report on Thursday.
*   Object Model: Proceed to implementing explicit method of determining where to forward an object.
*   Draft: Additions to be implemented into next draft.
