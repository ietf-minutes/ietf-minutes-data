## Summary

The Network Management Research Group (NMRG) session at IETF 118 covered a wide range of topics, including semantic interoperability for network management, network anomaly detection using semantic metadata, AI frameworks for network management, digital twin definitions and use cases, intent-based networking management automation, green networking challenges, and a scalable zero-touch routing architecture (Kira). The session involved presentations, discussions, and calls for feedback, aiming to advance research and collaboration in network management.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Semantic Interoperability:** Discussed the importance of semantic interoperability for heterogeneous network data sources, focusing on ontologies and knowledge graphs to link conceptual and physical levels of data modeling. Explored approaches for extracting knowledge from YANG modules and semantic annotations for YANG.
*   **Network Anomaly Detection:** Presented a model for network anomaly detection using semantic metadata, emphasizing the need for labeled data exchange and standardization of network symptoms. Discussed the challenges of generating relevant anomaly data and the importance of learning from real-world network incidents.
*   **AI Framework for Network Management:** Introduced a framework for applying AI methods to network management, focusing on data lifecycle support, problem identification, and composition of management functions. Discussed aligning the framework with digital twin concepts and intent-based networking.
*   **Digital Twin Definition:** Debated the definition of a network digital twin, contrasting two viewpoints: one defining it as a controller (analyze, decide, and act) and the other as a model (analyze only). Discussed the role of intent and the potential for using machine learning to build network models.
*   **Intent-Based Networking (IBN) Automation:** Presented a use case for IBN management automation in 5G networks, covering the framework, data model, intent translator, and assurance. Explored the use of security policy translators and highlighted a testbed implementation with IoT devices.
*   **Green Networking:** Updated on the draft concerning challenges and opportunities in green networking, with a focus on visibility, instrumentation, and optimization of networks for sustainability. Highlighted potential future research topics, including metrics, algorithms, and intent-based networking for green operations.
*   **Kira Routing Architecture:** Introduced Kira, a scalable zero-touch routing architecture for autonomous control planes, emphasizing its resilience, loop-free operation, and support for IPv6 connectivity. Discussed its potential use in 6G core infrastructure and its applicability for transporting telemetry data for AI.
*   **Anomaly detection and Data sharing:** Highlighted the difficulties of obtaining labelled data and expressed the view that vendor standardization is needed.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Semantic Interoperability:** Natalia was encouraged to follow up with Benoit regarding annotations in YANG.
*   **Green Networking:** The chairs plan to re-assess the maturity of the "Green Networking" draft in the coming weeks.
*   **Intent Based Networking:** Encouraged connection with other use cases to explore potential synergies.
*   **All:** Participants were urged to contribute to discussions on the mailing list and offline to further develop positions, arguments, and references.
*   **Chairs:** Planning interim meetings to progress the covered topics.

## Next Steps

*   Schedule interim meetings to delve deeper into specific research areas, particularly AI frameworks, digital twin definitions, and intent-based networking.
*   Encourage offline discussions and contributions to the mailing list to advance the research agenda.
*   Reassess the maturity of the "Green Networking" draft and consider next steps for publication.
*   Explore the possibility of a joint NMRG and E-Impact workshop on green networking topics.
*   Release the code for Kira, the scalable zero-touch routing architecture.
