## Summary

The NTP working group meeting covered updates on several drafts including NTP registries, NTPv5 requirements, NTPv5 protocol specification, Rough Time, NTP over PTP, and NTS for PTP. Discussions centered on the readiness of drafts for working group last call, addressing outstanding issues, and encouraging reviews and contributions from the working group.  A hackathon update was also presented, focusing on NTPv5 implementation and interoperability.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **NTP Registries Draft:** Close to completion, minor points to address regarding dashes/underscores. Rich to update within two weeks, chairs to find designated experts.
*   **Hackathon Update:** NTPv5 support integrated into NTP-DRS main branch, public test server set up. Discussions needed on the upgrade protocol.
*   **NTPv5 Requirements Specification:** Doug had comments regarding smearing algorithms and the "non-requirements" section.  Discussion about mode 6 support (should vs. must not).  Working group last call approved.
*   **NTPv5 Protocol Specification:** Marislav to send an email to the mailing list summarizing outstanding issues. Doug suggested defining root delay and root dispersion, and more discussion on correction fields and security.
*   **Rough Time:** Kristofer is seeking interested parties to work on the stalled draft, aiming to start work within the next two months.
*   **NTP over PTP:**  Improved introduction and added support for PTP 1-step and transparent clocks. Doug offered guidance on using the IETF organization number for TLVs instead of involving the IEEE. Ready for working group last call.
*   **NTS for PTP:** Implementation in progress. Expected to become an official working group draft document possibly at the beginning of 2024.
