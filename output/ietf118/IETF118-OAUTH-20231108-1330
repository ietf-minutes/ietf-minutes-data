## Summary

The OAuth working group held a meeting covering several topics, including resource server metadata, SD-JWT based verifiable credentials, attestation based client authentication, browser based apps, cross device flows, and OAuth status lists. Discussions focused on clarifying specifications, addressing open issues, and exploring future directions for each topic.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Resource Server Metadata:**
    *   Debated whether the WWW-Authenticate header should return the resource identifier or a resource metadata URL.
    *   Discussed the implications of returning a full URL versus a logical identifier, including potential issues with dot-well-known construction and the relationship between the resource identifier and metadata location.
    *   Concern raised regarding potential ISG pushback related to the well-known path construction.
    *   Discussion of returning full URL to resource metadata to simplify client discovery process.
*   **SD-JWT Based Verifiable Credentials:**
    *   Discussed renaming the "type" claim to "verifiable credential type" (VCT) and defining the concept of a credential type.
    *   Debated the normative use of DIDs for issuer key discovery and the potential for deferring to ecosystem-specific rules.
    *   Explored mechanisms for verifiers to obtain issuer verification keys, including X.509 headers, well-known issuer metadata, and DID resolution.
*   **Attestation Based Client Authentication:**
    *   Addressed replay attack detection for client attestations, focusing on the use of jot IDs and nonces.
    *   Discussed integrating attestation into token requests and PAR endpoints.
    *   Explored the use of authenticate or assurance levels.
    *   Concerns were raised that this effort overlaps with dynamic client registration.
*   **Browser Based Apps:**
    *   Updates on the restructuring of the draft to focus on threat models and different application architectures.
    *   Discussion of sender constrained tokens and the use of depop.
*   **Cross Device Flows:**
    *   Introduced a new attack pattern: cross-device session transfer.
    *   Discussed mitigating attacks by requesting binding without out-of-band data.
    *   Described "authenticate and initiate" to authenticate the end-user.
    *   Observed exploits include fake helpdesk scams and consent request overloads.
*   **OAuth Status List:**
    *   Discussion around creating a status list or a revocation mechanism.
    *   Discussed having option for unsigned status list.
    *   Addressed privacy considerations and compared to X.509 based revocation.
    *   Determined it should scale and integrate well.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Resource Server Metadata:** Editors to take a pass at returning the metadata path directly in the WWW-Authenticate header, and also include security considerations in normative text.
*   **SD-JWT Based Verifiable Credentials:** Discuss use of DID's offline.
*   **Browser Based Apps:** Move section discussing sender constrained tokens higher in the document, to before the security considerations. Justin and Neil to review the latest version of the document.
*   **Cross Device Flows:** Update the formal analysis section, and request reviewers for next version with new edits. Tony agreed to review.

## Next Steps

*   **Resource Server Metadata:** Resolve open issues and consider working group last call.
*   **Browser Based Apps:** Justin and Neil to review the document.
*   **Cross Device Flows:** Next version of the spec is expected to be available early next year, followed by reviewers.
*   **OAuth Status List:** Provide an option for an unsigned status list, change from Gzip to Zillow, and continue to test the implementation.
