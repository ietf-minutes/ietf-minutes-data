## Summary

This OAuth working group meeting covered several key topics, including transaction tokens for microservices, identity chaining across trust domains, client attestation in dynamic client registration, OAuth for first-party applications, and global token revocation. Discussions focused on refining specifications, addressing security concerns, and exploring potential overlaps and synergies between different drafts.  Several drafts were considered for working group adoption.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Transaction Tokens (George Fletcher):**
    *   Purpose: Authorization within microservice environments, creating immutable context for transactions.
    *   Discussion: Downscoping, use of `subject_id` claim, issuer claim requirement, sender constraint, inclusion of PII (IP addresses).  Consideration of SDJOT.
    *   Downscoping defined as fining the authority to the transaction, not attenuation later.
    *   ACTION: Justin will add an issue about the potential leverage of SDJOT.
    *   ACTION: Mike will review the specification on the TxN claim.

*   **Identity Chaining Across Trust Domains (Pedro Castellanos):**
    *   Purpose: Preserving context as transactions move across trust boundaries using token exchange and assertion framework.
    *   Discussion: Models for microservices acting as clients, high assurance use cases with authorization servers as clients, token type limitations (JWT only), and claim transcription.

*   **Attestation for DCR (Ned Smith):**
    *   Purpose:  Verify clients within a confidential computing environment during Dynamic Client Registration.
    *   Discussion: Combination with attestation-based client authentication, separation of attestation from presentation, architectural considerations, terminology, and a Rats Verifier role. Merging the effort was recommended to avoid duplicated effort.

*   **OAuth for First-Party Applications (Aaron Parecki):**
    *   Purpose: Provide better UX for first-party mobile apps while using OAuth.
    *   Discussion:  Authorization challenge endpoint, device session renaming to auth session, error responses, potential for FIDO/passkey integration, security concerns regarding unauthenticated flows, and relationship to PAR. Discussion about including an explicit launch endpoint and about how best to retrieve a Nonce.
    *   ACTION: Jacob to review the specification.

*   **Global Token Revocation (Aaron Parecki):**
    *   Purpose:  Provide a simple API for applications to revoke tokens based on a user identifier.
    *   Discussion:  Existing standards limitations (RFC 7009, OpenID Connect back channel logout, Shared Signals), existing proprietary implementations, security concerns with the 404 response indicating user existence, potential addition of a session identifier, and 200 or 204 as responses.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Transaction Tokens:**
    *   Justin to create an issue on SDJOT.
    *   Mike to look at the TXN claim.
    *   Outcome: Adopted to WG on the mailing list.

*   **Identity Chaining:**
    *   Adopted to WG on the mailing list.

*   **Attestation for DCR:**
     *   No decision made. Need to have further investigation with Aaron.

*   **Global Token Revocation:**
     *   ACTION: To be considered at a later time.
*   **OAuth for First-Party Applications (Aaron Parecki):**
    * ACTION: Jacob will review the document and post comments to the mailing list.

## Next Steps

*   Confirm adoption decisions on the mailing list.
*   Authors to address feedback from the meeting and continue refining their drafts.
*   Further discussion and potential collaboration on attestation-related drafts.
*   Continue discussing the nonce requirement for OAuth, with potential for a new launch endpoint.
