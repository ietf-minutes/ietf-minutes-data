# opsawg

## Summary

The opsawg meeting at IETF 118 covered several topics, including updates on RFC publications, adopted working group documents, and presentations on drafts related to IPFIX extensions, policy-based network control, data manifests, network packet loss mitigation, incident management, data provenance, and telemetry data storage. The meeting also featured discussion of side meetings and a reminder to provide feedback for the nomcom process.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **RFC Status:** Several new RFCs have been published, and multiple documents are nearing completion for final publication, including SRv6 and related drafts.
*   **Document Shepherd Role:** Announcement of the opportunity to become a document shepherd for adopted working group documents.
*   **IPFIX Extensions:** Presentation on IPFIX extension drafts, including TCP and UDP options, with a discussion of out-of-scope considerations like routing options.
*   **Policy-Based Network Control:** Update on the YANG data model for policy-based network control and extensions, including a discussion of endpoint group IDs and integration with schedule YANG.
*   **Data Manifest:** Presentation and discussion of the data manifest draft, focusing on metadata for telemetry data, and handling of absent values.
*   **Network Packet Loss Mitigation:** Discussion of a draft focusing on minimizing network packet loss by automating remediation and identifying root causes. The draft proposes a classification scheme for packet discards.
*   **Incident Management:** Presentation on the incident management draft, including use cases and model design, aiming to reduce duplicate troubleshooting tickets.
*   **Data Provenance:** Update on the data provenance draft, focusing on ensuring the origin and integrity of YANG data sets using COSE signatures.
*   **Telemetry Data Storage:** Discussion of mapping YANG-based telemetry data to time-series databases and challenges related to data scale and database selection.
*   **Side Meetings:** Announcement of various ops-related side meetings during IETF 118.
*   **Nomcom Feedback:** Reminder to provide feedback for the nomcom process for selecting ops area directors.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **IPFIX Extensions:** The working group agreed to leave routing options and destination options out of scope for the IPFIX extension drafts.
*   **IPFIX Extensions:** Working group last call was requested for all three IPFIX related documents.
*   **Incident Management:** There was interest expressed in adopting the incident management draft.
*   **Side Meetings:** Chiu Phang and Chen requested to share the side meeting information on the mailing list.

## Next Steps

*   Send the side meeting information to the mailing list.
*   Discuss incident management adoption on the mailing list.
*   Authors of drafts to address feedback received during the meeting.
*   Continue work on the common schedule, YANG data model.
