## Summary

The Path Computation Element (PCE) working group session covered a wide range of topics including working group status, updates on several drafts nearing completion, and discussions on extensions for FlexGrid, segment routing, stateful PCE, and new proposals for fine-grained transport networks and precision availability. Key discussions revolved around terminology, error handling, implementation status, and applicability of new features. Several documents are approaching working group last call.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **PCE Yang Model:** Discussion on removing must statements and error messages from read-only leaves in the operational state due to debate on their usefulness.
*   **FlexGrid Document:** Ready for working group last call pending author redirect of the draft.
*   **SR Policy Association:** Updates reflect previous meeting discussions, focusing on removing multiple optimization objectives.
*   **EC Optional:** Stable and nearing working group last call, needing an implementation section.
*   **Stateful Inter-Domain:** Discussion on error handling, PC session cleanup, and the relationship with the state synchronization document.
*   **P2MP SR Policy:** Discussion on path instances, leaf types, global vs. local optimization, slicing, and potential need for a separate SRv6 draft. Concerns were raised on termonology for path instances.
*   **Security Considerations for RFC 8253:**  Working group last call comments addressed by refining the scope and focusing on connection establishment restrictions for TLS versions.
*   **Fine-Grained Transport Networks:** Requirements for PCE extensions discussed, particularly concerning high channel counts and dynamic path changes, coordination with the CCAMP working group emphasized.
*   **Precision Availability:**  New metric object extensions proposed for characterizing path performance based on historical behavior and SLOs. The fixed length metric object type and motivations need to be considered.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **PCE Yang Model:** Remove must statements and error messages from read-only leaves in the operational state, contingent on ongoing discussions on the netmod mailing list.
*   **FlexGrid Document:** Chairs to request authors to redirect the draft for working group last call.
*   **EC Optional:** Authors to add an implementation section to the document.
*   **Stateful Inter-Domain:** Authors to add implementation sections and descriptions for error handling and cleanup. To refer to the the error handling document to see if there is an ideal way to implement error handling.
*   **P2MP SR Policy:** Authors to add implementation status, and the term "instance" needs to be clarified in the document.
*   **Security Considerations for RFC 8253:** Re-run working group last call.
*   **Fine-Grained Transport Networks:** Authors to further discuss with CCAMP and to trigger some new discussions.
*   **Precision Availability:** Authors to revise the new metric object type for extension and to work on use case explanations.

## Next Steps

*   Progress drafts nearing working group last call.
*   Address feedback and action items for each document.
*   Continue discussions on open issues, particularly regarding terminology and error handling.
*   Coordinate with CCAMP on fine-grained transport network requirements.
*   Further explore applicability and implementation of precision availability metrics.
