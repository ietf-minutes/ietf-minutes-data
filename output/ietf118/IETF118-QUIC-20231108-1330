# quic

## Summary

This QUIC working group session covered several key topics, including demultiplexing of version negotiation packets, multipath QUIC, reliable stream resets, qlog updates, NAT traversal solutions, accurate timestamping, and potential future work items.  The group reached tentative decisions on version negotiation and stream resets, and discussed path ID's, with the decision on that deferred. There were also discussions on NAT traversal and timestamps.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Demultiplexing of Version Negotiation Packets:** Discussed the ambiguity in RFC 9000 regarding the QUIC bit in version negotiation packets, and the potential conflict with RFC 7983. Several options were proposed, including changing RFC 9000, RFC 9443, or simply clarifying the existing text.
*   **Multipath QUIC:** Presented updates on Draft 6, including new frame types for path status (standby and available) and clarified path usage for sending data.  The main issue discussed was whether to use explicit path IDs or rely on connection IDs.
*   **Reliable Stream Resets:** Updates on the draft, including renaming "reliable reset stream" to "reset stream at". Discussed a proposal for a "stop sending at" frame, but concerns were raised about its necessity and use cases.
*   **qlog Updates:**  Discussed removing QPACK-related events from the core qlog document to a separate document due to lack of implementation experience and active blocking of progress. Also, discussed the proposal for Path ID assignments in the qlog schema for use with connection migration events.
*   **NAT Traversal Solutions (Nutriversal):** Presented two drafts related to NAT traversal, including using QUIC frames to request and exchange IP addresses, and supporting peer-to-peer QUIC connections where both endpoints are behind NATs. Concerns were raised about potential fragmentation of NAT traversal solutions and the complexity of replicating ICE functionality in QUIC.
*   **Accurate Timestamping:** Discussed reviving a draft extension for conveying accurate timestamps on received packets within ACK frames. The benefits of improved RTT measurements for latency-sensitive applications were highlighted.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Version Negotiation Packets:**  The group tentatively agreed to pursue **Option 4** - to change the text that decorates the "should" setting for the most significant bit, to provide a bit more information towards is about why setting it to 0 or 1 might help or not depending on outbound knowledge and that people wanna take risks you can make guesses, that's fine, but they they understand what they're they're asking themselves for.
*   **Multipath QUIC:** After discussion and a show of hands, the authors will prepare a PR to explore path IDs further based on the existing issue 2014. Martin Seemann will prepare the PR.
*   **Reliable Stream Resets:** The working group decided against including a "stop sending at" frame in the current draft. Authors will proceed to finalize the reliable stream resets draft.
*   **qlog:** The working group agreed to remove QPACK-related events from the core qlog document to a separate document.
*   **Multipath QUIC:** Close 2073

## Next Steps

*   Authors to take feedback and act on the discussion on the mailing list.
*   Continue discussing NAT traversal and accurate timestamps on the mailing list.
*   Chairs will determine timeline for working group last call for Reliable Stream Resets.
