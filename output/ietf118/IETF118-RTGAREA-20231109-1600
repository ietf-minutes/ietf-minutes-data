## Summary

The Routing Area meeting covered several key topics, including updates from Area Directors, a report on the Routing Area Director (RAD) function, and a discussion about agenda item inclusion criteria for working group meetings. Sue Harris presented insights from her PhD dissertation on leadership in standards organizations and the IESG.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Area Director Updates:**  Area Directors welcomed a new LSR co-chair (Jing Jin Koo) and an interim MPLS chair (Adrian Farrell). They emphasized the smooth operation of working groups in the area.
*   **Routing Area Director (RAD) Update:** RAD co-chair Daniel Enriquez provided a report on document reviews, reviewer assignments, and upcoming process improvements.  Key areas of focus: Improving turnaround time for reviews, and streamlining the accept/reject process for reviewers.
*   **Working Group Agenda Item Inclusion Criteria:** Discussion centered on a proposal to require mailing list discussion prior to a draft appearing on a working group agenda.  The goals are to ensure more participants have read and considered documents before in-person discussions and to improve efficiency in the limited face-to-face time.  A number of exceptions were discussed.
*   **Author List Length:**  A lengthy discussion occurred regarding author lists on drafts. Suggestions included removing the existing limit, and having a tracked history of who contributed text to documents. Concerns were raised about motivations for adding authors (bonuses, corporate support vs. actual contribution) and related impacts to credibility.
*   **Sue Harris Presentation:** Sue Harris presented research on effective IESG leadership and dynamics, sharing insights on data-driven measures, the importance of solidarity, and the need for ADs to act as good managers and inspiring leaders.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **RAD Process Improvement:** Daniel Enriquez to follow up with reviewers to ensure timely acknowledgment (accept/reject) of document review assignments. If no response within 7 days, the document will be reassigned.
*   **WG Agenda Item Inclusion Guidelines:** The Area Directors will refine the proposal for working group agenda item inclusion criteria based on the discussion, with the understanding that it should be a guideline and not a strict rule. They will engage with working group chairs in a follow-up discussion. Some changes to the wording of the guidelines should be considered around items such as 'new drafts' and external presentations.
*   **Action Items regarding author list length:** ADs to consider and follow up on all feedback and suggestions.
*   **Tooling:** Check for better data tracker tooling to notify users via email of new LSR drafts

## Next Steps

*   Area Directors to schedule a working group chairs chat to further discuss the agenda item inclusion proposal.
*   Area Directors to discuss data tracker updates for tracking LSR drafts.
*   Area Directors to discuss any potential updates to the draft author guidelines.
