## Summary

This session covered the status of various working group documents, ongoing liaison activities, and potential new work areas. Key topics included the progress of several YANG modeling drafts, the "enhanced VPN" discussion, scalability considerations for NRPs, and alignment between network slicing realization and application drafts. Decisions were made on how to proceed with some documents, and action items were assigned to address open issues.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Working Group Document Status:** A detailed review of the progress of various drafts, including those nearing working group last call, those already in the RFC editor queue, and those requiring further work. Special attention was given to documents related to ACTN, network slicing, and YANG models.
*   **Enhanced VPN Discussion:** A poll was conducted regarding renaming "enhanced VPN" to "NRP-based VPN". The results were inconclusive, leading to a decision to continue the discussion on the mailing list.
*   **VN Type in VN YANG Model:** A discussion on whether to explicitly specify the VN type in the VN YANG model, with suggestions to analyze use cases to inform the decision.
*   **URI Format in VN YANG Model:** Issues related to URI formatting in JSON examples were discussed, along with a request for assistance in providing valid JSON examples.
*   **RSC 8776bis Updates:** Discussions on whether to include a summary of changes in an appendix and how to handle path loss metrics and full LSP routing configuration.
*   **Traffic Engineering LSP YANG Model:** The document is under working group last call and encouraged further reviews.
*   **NBI YANG Model:** A discussion around the the Topology and AC issues and if per cost support should be added.
*   **NRP Scalability Considerations:** A discussion on the scalability of NRPs, including control and data plane aspects, and a call for a scalable deconstruction section in related drafts.
*   **Network Slice Authorization Draft:** The document now has clear scopes with the other related draft with fixed.
*   **Network Slice Application Draft:** Agreement to include examples of mapping for further clarity in the specification.
*   **NIPI API Model:** Updates was presented and guidance was request from chairs to move on to the working group adoption.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Enhanced VPN Naming:** The discussion on renaming "enhanced VPN" to "NRP-based VPN" will continue on the mailing list.
*   **VN Type in VN YANG Model:** Analyze use cases in regards to the use cases.
*   **RSC 8776bis Updates:** Need to update based on the MPS and then proceed with Last Call.
*   **NBI YANG Model:** Incorporate additional documentation for support on per cost.
*   **NBI API Model:** The documentation should be completed and clarified before moving forward.

## Next Steps

*   Authors to address the open issues identified for the discussed drafts.
*   Working group to review documents nearing last call and provide feedback.
*   Continue discussions on the mailing list for topics like "enhanced VPN" naming and scaling considerations.
*   Working group to coordinate with other SDOs, such as 3GPP and ORAN, through ongoing liaison activities.
*   Chair to plan additional meetings to address remaining topics.
