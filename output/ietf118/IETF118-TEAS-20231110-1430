## Summary

This meeting covered several drafts related to traffic engineering, network slicing, and topology models. Discussions focused on customer topology intents for network slices, leveraging the TE Topology model for non-TE applications, an MPLS-TE topology model, and bandwidth availability in the context of microwave topologies. A final presentation covered BGP extensions for SR policy in relation to NRP. Several working group adoption polls were taken.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Customer Topology Intent for Network Slices:**
    *   Motivation is for customers to express desired slice service topology for realization and operation hints.
    *   The goal is to provide hints on how to realize the slice, not to control the slice.
    *   Concerns were raised about the necessity of prior topology information, mapping customized topologies, the expressiveness of connectivity constructs, and the sufficiency of existing models.
    *   The draft aims to address similar requirements as ACTN type 2, but with a topology model that includes SLAs.
    *   It was clarified that the model is complementary to slice service models, not a replacement.
    *   Resource isolation and reservation aspects were discussed, potentially relating to network resource partitioning using NRPs.
    *   Referenced RFC 8453 (ACTN/VBN) for historical context.

*   **TE Topology Model for Non-TE Applications:**
    *   The goal is to highlight the applicability of a subset of the TE Topology model for non-TE applications, particularly in network slicing.
    *   Addressing gaps in RFC 85765 with features from RFC 8795.
    *   Addressed the concern about the size and complexity of the TE Topology model by emphasizing the optional nature of many attributes.
    *   Discussed methods for augmenting existing models with TE Topology profiles.
    *   Addressed the issue of how clients can determine the implemented topology profile on the server.

*   **MPLS-TE Topology Model:**
    *   Focuses on identifying gaps in the MPLS-TE YANG model needed to manage MPLS-TE network slices.
    *   Aims to augment the packet topology model with MPLS-TE specific aspects.
    *   Aligned the model with RFC 776's BICS (Behavior, Information, Context, Structure) model.
    *   Improved the abstract based on feedback.
    *   Open issues include clarifying that MPLS-TE is a subset of MPLS, supporting MPLS multi-domain, and adding the MPLS label in the record.

*   **Bandwidth Availability:**
    *   Presents a generic bandwidth availability module extracted from a microwave topology draft.
    *   Aim is to understand what bandwidth availability means across technologies and how it ties to topologies.
    *   Intended as informational, providing bandwidth status, and not enforcement.
    *   Discussed reporting bandwidth availability in microwave links, considering weather conditions.
    *   Considered other areas for YANG bandwidth availability modeling, potentially M&A, TVR, or RAW (Debt Net).

*   **BGP Extensions for SR Policy:**
    *   Addresses associating an NRP ID with an SR policy candidate path via BGP.
    *   Defines a new NRP sub-TLV in the BGP tunnel encapsulation attribute.
    *   Discussed operational considerations, including consistency between SR policies and NRPs.
    *   Scalability considerations were added, analyzing the impact of increasing the number of NRPs on BGP signaling.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Customer Topology Intent for Network Slices:**
    *   Action: Refine the draft, address pending comments, and review the draft focusing on hints for validation.
    *   Decision: Further discussion is needed before working group adoption can be considered.

*   **TE Topology Model for Non-TE Applications:**
    *   Action: Remove geolocation from the draft and reference the standalone RFC instead.
    *   Decision: Consider making the draft an informational document.

*   **MPLS-TE Topology Model:**
    *   Decision: Assess this model for working group adoption, based on the generally positive feedback.

*   **Bandwidth Availability:**
    *   Action: Scott will contact relevant mailing lists to discuss potentially adopting a single generic radio related YANG model.
    *   Action: Contact Rob (from ops area) for AD input.

*   **BGP Extensions for SR Policy:**
    *   Action: Monitor IDR working group adoption.

## Next Steps

*   Continue discussion on mailing lists for all drafts.
*   Address open issues and comments.
*   Coordinate with other working groups as needed.
*   Determine the appropriate venue for bandwidth availability modeling in YANG.
*   Revisit working group adoption for drafts after further revisions and discussions.
