## Summary

This meeting of the Transport Services Working Group (TSVWG) covered several key topics, including updates on GitHub status, RFC progress, and ongoing work items.  Presentations were given on the DTLS over SCTP design team's progress, careful resumption of congestion control state, and multi-path DCCP. The DTLS over SCTP discussion focused on defining requirements and exploring implementation options, with a goal to propose a way forward for the working group.  The careful resumption presentation highlighted recent hackathon activity and refinements to the draft.  Multi-path DCCP status was also presented, focusing on language improvements and addressing open issues.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **GitHub Status:** 6 of 7 working group drafts have been moved to GitHub, allowing for issues and pull requests.
*   **RFC Status:** No new RFCs published. Two documents are with the IESG, and one is in first working group last call.
*   **DTLS over SCTP:** The design team presented its requirements analysis for securing SCTP-based communication, focusing on cloud deployments and 3GPP requirements. Key areas of discussion included message size limits, support for multiple streams, and security considerations against on-path attackers. The design team was tasked with developing a suggested way forward for the working group by the end of the year.
*   **Careful Resumption:**  A hackathon project implemented careful resume in quiche. Refinements to the draft were discussed, including handling data-limited connections, splitting the unvalidated phase, and utilizing byte estimation for safe retreat. There was discussion regarding the storage time for RTT and BDP values.
*   **Multi-Path DCCP:** The draft has been updated with language improvements and guidance on sequence number space exhaustion. The goal is to address remaining issues and proceed to a working group last call.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **DTLS over SCTP Design Team:** The design team will meet at the IETF to plan a way forward and will provide a suggestion on how to progress to the working group by the end of the year. This update will be published as an Internet Draft.
*   **Multi-Path DCCP:** Authors will address remaining issues and aim to publish version 12 by the end of the year.

## Next Steps

*   DTLS over SCTP design team to formulate a suggested way forward for the working group by the end of the year.
*   Multi-Path DCCP authors to address outstanding issues in the issue tracker and publish a new version of the draft, potentially leading to a working group last call.
*   Continue development and discussion on the careful resumption draft.
