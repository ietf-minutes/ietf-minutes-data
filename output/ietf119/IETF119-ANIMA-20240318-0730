## Summary
The anima working group meeting at IETF 119 focused on the status of ongoing working group documents and discussions around future directions, including the potential adoption of new work. Key topics included updates on GRASP distribution, JWS voucher, Brusky Cloud, Brusky PRM, Constrained Voucher and Proxy, and discussions around the use of YANG vs CDDL for voucher specifications. A new proposal for a network version of GRASP was presented, sparking discussion regarding its scope and potential overlap with existing technologies.

## Key Discussion Points
*   **Document Status Updates:** Detailed updates were provided on the progress of several key documents moving through the IETF process, including GRASP distribution, JWS voucher, and Brusky Cloud.
*   **Brusky PRM Update:** Stefan provided an update on Brusky PRM, emphasizing that no major changes were made, but clarifications and improvements were implemented based on previous discussions and shepherd reviews.
*   **Voucher YANG vs. CDDL Discussion:** The working group discussed whether to stick with YANG or transition to CDDL for voucher specifications (RFC 8366 bis). Concerns were raised regarding the availability of tooling for YANG and the lack of its usage in similar protocols. Ultimately, the group decided to defer the decision to the next revision (ter).
*   **New GRASP Proposal:** Sheng presented a proposal for a network version of GRASP, aiming to reduce dependencies on IPv6 and TCP, potentially using UDP or QUIC.
*   **GRASP Proposal Scope and Charter:** Concerns were raised about the proposed GRASP extension being out of scope for the current anima charter. It was suggested that a rechartering or alternative avenues (e.g., Ops Directorate) might be needed. The group also discussed the potential benefits of CoAP as an alternative.

## Decisions and Action Items
*   **Constrained Voucher/Proxy:** Chairs will send a request to the working group seeking additional authors for these documents to help with reviewing and progressing them.
*   **Brusky Discovery:** Tore will post version 00 of the Brusky Discovery draft.
*   **Network Service Auto Deployment:** Tore will follow up with the authors to provide additional feedback.
*   **RFC 8366 bis (Voucher):** The working group decided to defer the decision on the use of YANG vs. CDDL for the voucher specification to the next revision (ter). Michael will validate the new document serializes the same as the old document.
*   **Interim Meeting:** Chairs will schedule an interim meeting, looking at the last week of April to progress discussion and streamline on open issues.

## Next Steps
*   Authors to incorporate comments from Shepherd review on Brusky PRM.
*   Michael to validate changes to the yang module of RFC 8366bis.
*   Explore adoption venue for a network version of GRASP protocol, with suggestion to first create an implementation and documentation.
*   Schedule interim meeting.
