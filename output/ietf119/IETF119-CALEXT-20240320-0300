## Summary

This Calext working group session at IETF 119 in Brisbane focused on the progress of several drafts related to calendaring and scheduling. The discussion covered JS Contact updates, the JS Calendar/iCalendar mapping document, CalTasks, server-side subscriptions, iCalendar series, and VPOLL. Key decisions included parking some inactive drafts and prioritizing certain documents for publication. A recurring theme was the need for broader implementation and testing, particularly from major vendors.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **JS Contact:** Documents are in RFC Editor queue. Awaiting updates.
*   **JS Calendar/iCalendar Mapping:** Work restarted, focusing on defining a standard conversion between iCalendar and JS Calendar. They are extracting examples from the Internet Draft to generate tests and verify their backend. Aiming for multiple implementations and cross-testing.
*   **Expired Drafts:**
    *   **Server-Side Subscriptions:**  Decision to park due to lack of current implementation interest.
    *   **iCalendar Series:**  Mike to refresh the document and attempt to progress it.
