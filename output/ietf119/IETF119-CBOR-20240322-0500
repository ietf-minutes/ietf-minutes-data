## Summary
The cbor working group session at IETF 119 in Brisbane covered several key topics: diagnostic notation (EDN) and concise data definition language (CDDL) progress, Yang Seaborne integration, and CBOR packing and table setup. The session included a tutorial on EDN and CDDL, discussions on draft advancement, and potential new work items for the working group.

## Key Discussion Points
*   **EDN & CDDL Tutorial:** A review and discussion of recent progress on diagnostic notation (EDN) and Concise Data Definition Language (CDDL).
*   **EDN Literals:** Use of application-oriented literals in EDN, particularly `E` for external references to CDDL and `REF` for referencing other EDN files. The goal is to reduce hardcoding values directly in examples.
*   **CDDL Modules:** The proposed module structure for CDDL, including `include` and `import` directives for composing CDDL grammars from multiple files.  There was discussion on how files should be found using an include path mechanism.
*   **CDDL Control Operators:** Discussion regarding minimizing seabor det control operators to favor just cbor cddl or the deterministic CBOR profile
*   **Yang Seaborne:** Discussion on integrating Seaborne with YANG data models for more efficient representation of data types. Concerns about deterministic representations and media type negotiation. Integration via Yang augmentations was discussed as well
*   **CBOR Packing:** CBOR packing for applying compression at the data model level. The consumer of a data item can work directly out of the pact representation.
*   **CBOR Table Setup:** Extending CBOR packed formats with more extensible and concise shared table setups.
*   **Draft Status:** Various drafts including time tag, EDL Literals, Yang Seaborn, and CBOR pact were discussed regarding their readiness and future steps.

## Decisions and Action Items
*   **Action Item:** Carsten to write a new call command about removing seabor det control operator
*   **Action Item:** Evaluate feedback regarding include vs. import for CDDL modules.
*   **Decision:** Discuss Yang Seaborne extensions and media type negotiation further, potentially in an interim meeting in April.
*   **Decision:** The CBOR working group will take on the table setup mechanism, evaluating this for future work.
*   **Action Item:** Solicit additional opinions on application-oriented table setup on the mailing list.

## Next Steps
*   Advance EDN Literals and Update Grammar document to ISG.
*   Continue working on CDDL module proposal and address remaining bugs, especially regarding sockets.
*   Hold an interim meeting in April to discuss Yang Seaborne integration strategies.
*   Evaluate the CBOR pact document and address open issues regarding error representation.
*   Gather feedback on table setup extensions.
*   Proposed date has already been set for future meeting.
