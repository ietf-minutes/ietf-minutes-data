# detnet

## Summary
The second detnet session at this IETF focused on enhanced data plane discussions. Key topics included updates on scaling requirements, a detailed review of the data plane taxonomy draft, and presentations on specific queuing mechanisms like EDF and Tiga-from, as well as C-SCORE and flow aggregation. The session aimed to characterize queuing proposals using the taxonomy, and explored challenges and solutions for achieving bounded latency and scalability in deterministic networks. There was also discussion on Wireless functionality.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Scaling Requirements Update:** Discussion on version 5 of the scaling requirements draft, focusing on enhancements to explanations, consideration of jitter bounds, end-to-end latency, and the complexity of queuing mechanism evaluation. Text was added regarding queuing solutions with multiple levels of detnet capabilities.
*   **Data Plane Taxonomy Draft:** A detailed overview of the taxonomy draft, which aims to categorize data plane solutions based on various criteria including performance characteristics, periodicity, network synchronization, traffic granularity, work conserving manner, target transmission time, and service order.
*   **Taxonomy Intercorrelations:** Exploration of the relationships between different taxonomies, such as the relationship between traffic granularity and the dominant factor for end-to-end latency bounds.
*   **EDF Queuing Mechanism:** Presentation and discussion on updates to the EDF queuing mechanism, including latency conversations, anti-mode, and a homomorphic topology example.
*   **Tiga-from Queuing Mechanism:** Updates on the Tiga-from queuing mechanism, covering time slot arrangements, BTM/BOM/FDM, run-time policy and delay jitter elimination, and taxonomic considerations.
*   **C-SCORE Queuing Mechanism:** Explanation and example of the C-SCORE queuing mechanisms and it's advantages over other CQF queuing proposals.
*   **Flow Aggregation:** Initial exploration of flow aggregation in enhanced detnet, identifying gaps and requirements related to scalability and fine-grained provisioning.
*   **Buffer Size Considerations:** A discussion about the constraints of buffer sizes in switches and routers in metropolitan networks, and how this can constrain solution options. Relatedly, several parties pointed out the trade-offs between buffer size and latency.
*   **Reference Topologies:** A lengthy discussion on reference topologies. The discussion focused on whether or not a reference topology was a use case. The determination was made that the taxonomy document should reference a topology, but is not a use case document.
*   **Wireless requirements:** Balaji highlighted the necessity of including aspects of wireless, special cases in queuing methods to accommodate wireless use cases.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Adoption of Taxonomy Draft:** The chairs indicated intent to move the taxonomy draft towards adoption, pending further discussion on the mailing list.
*   **Working Group Input on Topologies:** Once adopted, the working group, not just the authors, will contribute to and refine reference topologies.
*   **Review Yang Model for Aggregation:** Alper (incomplete) and others need to review the existing data documents, especially about the free, flow aggregation part and in particular, the Yang document and the aggregation section there.

## Next Steps

*   **Mailing List Discussion:** Continue discussions on the mailing list regarding topology, definitions, and justification.
*   **Taxonomy Refinement:** Authors to consider the inclusion of reference topologies and wireless aspects in the taxonomy draft and, particularly, the points raised in the discussion around reference topologies.
*   **Flow Aggregation Analysis:** Authors to analyze the existing data documents to determine gaps and clarifications for the flow aggregation section.
