## Summary
The DNSOP working group session at IETF 119 covered updates on various drafts, including 8109 bis (priming root queries), trust anchor publication for the root zone, compact denial of existence, NSP validation, and a new draft on DNS greasing. Hackathon results were presented, and discussions were held regarding adoption of new drafts and addressing open issues.

## Key Discussion Points
*   **8109 bis (Priming Root Queries):** Discussion arose concerning the current status of root zone operations and whether the document adequately addresses the special nature of the root zone operators.
*   **Trust Anchor Publication:** Concerns were raised regarding the reliance on transport security (TLS) instead of data origin authenticity when publishing the root zone trust anchor. The removal of certificates and certificate signing mechanisms was also discussed.
*   **Compact Denial of Existence:** The group discussed the treatment of explicit queries for Nx name, updates to RFCs 64034 and 4035, and the allocation of a meta type for Nx name.
*   **NSP Validation:**  Discussion covered the trustworthiness of infrastructure RRs and revalidation's role in reducing cache poisoning and query redirection risks.
*   **DNS Greasing:** A new draft on DNS greasing was presented, discussing the use of unallocated protocol code points to prevent ossification.  Points covered the protocol elements to grease, selection strategies, frequency, failure detection, and data collection.
*   **Generalized Notify Updates:** Updates on the draft related to DNS notifications and automation of delegation management. A key aspect discussed was the mechanism for discovering the notification target.
*   **Hackathon Results:** Presentations covered compact denial of existence implementation, discussions around Dileg, and automatic child-to-parent synchronization of delegation information.

## Decisions and Action Items
*   **8109 bis (Priming Root Queries):**  Mark Andrews to send proposed wording changes to the mailing list. The working group will review and provide feedback.
*   **Trust Anchor Publication:**  The authors will consider adding an IANA consideration section detailing required actions and make explicit that gossip is currently the fallback. The authors will also consider pre-announcing future trust anchors in the DNS.
*   **DNS Greasing:** This draft has been queued up for more discussions.
*   **Generalized Notify Updates:** The draft will be updated based on feedback received, including addressing concerns regarding DNSSEC and unsigned records.
*   **DNIS greased:** People asked for more information for the DNIS greased document, and will provide the info on the mailing list.
*   **All drafts:** Tim and Suzanne to update email list for the drafts.

## Next Steps
*   The chairs will initiate a thread on the mailing list to gather reviews on the DINS greased document.
*   Authors of various drafts will address open issues and feedback received during the session.
*   The working group will continue discussions on the mailing list to move drafts closer to working group last call.
