## Summary

This DNSOP session covered several topics, including a report on the DNS delegation BAF, updates on crypto-algorithm registry management for DNSSEC, ranking DNS data sources, automated delegation synchronization, and measurement of CDS/CDNSKEY inconsistencies.  The primary focus was on discussing and gathering feedback on proposed drafts for adoption.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **DNS Delegation (DD) BAF Report:** The BAF explored updating the DNS delegation mechanism. A new mailing list, dd@ietf.org, is dedicated to this topic. The aim is to develop a charter for a working group, focusing on problem identification before evaluating solutions. The IAB will decide on forming a working group.
*   **Crypto-Algorithm Registry Management:**  Three drafts were presented regarding crypto-algorithm management for DNSSEC:
    *   A draft to move recommendations into the IANA table.
    *   A draft stating "Must Not Use SHA1"
    *   A draft stating "Must Not GOS" - more specifically the ECE GOS.
    *   The approach is to use smaller RFC updates for incremental changes.
    *   Discussion revolved around requiring standard action for all changes except adding an algorithm with a "May" recommendation.
    *   The potential addition of a column for deployment level was suggested.
*   **Ranking DNS Data Sources:** Discussion on re-evaluating and potentially overhauling RFC 2181, section 5.4.1, concerning the ranking of DNS data.  Emphasis was placed on the need to acknowledge diverse operational contexts and policies, instead of aiming for a rigid linear ranking.
*   **Automated Delegation Synchronization:**  A discussion on automating delegation synchronization between child and parent zones, even in non-DNSSEC environments, by bootstrapping trust of the child key using various mechanisms like multi-vantage point validation or requiring operator confirmation. A potential downside is the possibility of a persistent hijack mechanism.
*   **CDS/CDNSKEY Inconsistencies:** A study on the frequency of inconsistencies in CDS and CDNSKEY records across authoritative name servers. Results show that roughly 0.1% of zones with these records have inconsistencies. The study highlighted specific cases, including issues with .ch and .com, and multi-provider setups (e.g., Google Domains and Wix DNS).

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Adoption of Crypto-Algorithm Registry Drafts:**
    *   Decision: Working group to consider adoption of the draft updating the tables, along with consideration of merging Peter and Schumann's comments regarding the addition of a deployment level column.
    *   Action:  Address concerns raised regarding the lack of a security explanation in the "Must Not Use SHA1" draft. Provide the reasoning for deprecation.
    *   Action: Call for working group adoption will occur for the first draft, as well as the "Must Not GOS" draft.

*   **Ranking DNS Data Sources Draft:**
    *   Decision: The working group will plan on calling for adoption of the draft.
    *   Action: The document should be taken to the mailing list to collect further comments and discussion.
*   **Automated Delegation Synchronization Draft:**
    *   Action: Yohan to continue discussion on the mailing list to refine bootstrapping mechanisms and address security concerns.

## Next Steps

*   Charter for the DD working group will continue to be discussed on the dedicated mailing list. The mailing list will remain open for discussion.
*   Address open issues and comments raised during the DNSOP session on the mailing lists, particularly regarding the ranking of DNS data and automated delegation synchronization.
*   Prepare for working group adoption calls for the crypto-algorithm registry drafts (after addressing the concerns about the "Must Not Use SHA1" draft) and the ranking of DNS data draft.
*   The discussion of automated delegation synchronization should continue to be thrashed out on the mailing list.
