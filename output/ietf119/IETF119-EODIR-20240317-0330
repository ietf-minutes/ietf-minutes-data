# Meetecho Introduction and Testing

## Summary

This session provided an introduction to the Meetecho client, covering key features and functionalities. Participants learned about joining the queue, direct messaging, identifying user types via icons, and best practices for sharing slides. The session also addressed questions from attendees and offered assistance with individual technical issues.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Meetecho Light vs. Full Client:** The Meetecho Light client is primarily for in-room participation and doesn't display video. The full client, accessible remotely, provides access to cameras, buttons, and all features.
*   **Chair Permissions:** Chairs have additional permissions, such as locking the queue and setting timers to control session time.
*   **Direct Messaging:** Participants can direct message others in the session by hovering over their name and clicking the chat bubble icon.
*   **Participant Icons:** Icons next to participants' names indicate their connection method (e.g., Meetecho Light, full client, Zulip chat).  Hovering over the icons provides more detail.
*   **Role Indicators:** Blue dots next to names indicate working group chairs, while yellow or red dots denote IAB or ISG members. Hovering over the dot displays the role.
*   **Sharing Slides:** Presenters should check with the chair beforehand to determine if they will be sharing slides or if the chair will share pre-uploaded slides. Only one person can share at a time.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Action Item:** Attendees wanting to add their picture to Meetecho should send a photo to support@ietf.org.

## Next Steps

*   Participants were encouraged to use Meetecho during the week and to reach out with any further questions.
*   Reminder to scan the QR code or enter the full client on the agenda to have their participation counted.
