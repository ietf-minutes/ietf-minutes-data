## Summary

This meeting of the global routing operations working group at IETF 119 covered a range of topics related to routing operations and monitoring. Presentations were given on a peering API proposal, updates to BMP-related drafts (TLV, EBIT, REL), BGP operational security best practices, and BMP statistics and reporting.  A request for working group adoption of a TCP AO specification for BMP was also made.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Peering API:**
    *   Presentation on a new API for programmatic handling of peering requests to automate inter-AS interconnection.
    *   Discussion on security considerations, authorization mechanisms, and future work on PNI connections and maintenance notifications.
    *   The need for a state machine to manage the provisioning workflow and expectations.
*   **BMP TLV, EBIT, and REL Drafts:**
    *   Updates on the TLV draft to reduce parsing complexity and improve group TLV indexing.
    *   Discussion on the EBIT draft and the need for coordinated updates with the TLV draft.
    *   Debate regarding overlapping functionality between root mirroring and root event logging (REL), especially for sampling erroneous packets; suggestion to move erroneous update logging to event-oriented messages.
*   **BGP Operational Security Best Practices:**
    *   Discussion on the scope and nature of the BGP operational security best practices document, including potential for it being used as inspiration for policy and laws.
    *   Proposal to split the current draft into a BCP (high-level principles), an informational document (techniques), and a terminology document.
    *   Concerned about the document's maintainability and the need to avoid excessive detail that can quickly become outdated.
*   **BMP Statistics and Reporting:**
    *   Presentation of new BMP stat types and definitions for aggregated BMP route monitor messages.
    *   Discussion on the feasibility and usefulness of the proposed new stat counters, particularly the impact on router performance.
    *   Suggestion to leverage existing BMP extensions for the various Palo BMP extensions
    *   Suggestion to refactor the counters to be built on the Yang modules.
*   **TCP AO for BMP:**
    *   Discussion on standardizing TCP AO for BMP and supporting it as a supported profile to encourage vendors to implement it.
    *   Support for producing a small RFC specifying the use of TCP AO for BMP.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Peering API:** The chair will issue a call for working group adoption of the peering API draft.
*   **BGP Operational Security Best Practices:** The draft will be slimmed down to focus on high-level principles, with separate informational documents created for terminology and techniques.
*   **BMP Statistics and Reporting:** The presenter will follow-up on existing Yang Models to address the proposed statistics.
*   **TCP AO for BMP:** A formal request to adopt a short RFC specifying TCP AO for BMP will be made.

## Next Steps

*   Discussion of the peering API at the side meeting on March 21st.
*   Continue discussion and feedback on all drafts on the mailing list.
*   Explore the appropriate working group for the Yang modules mentioned during the BMP Statistics discussion.
