# httpbis

## Summary

This meeting covered updates and discussions on several HTTP-related drafts, including cookie specification, signature authentication, query method, and resumable uploads. The main discussion points were the resolution of the "same site redirect chain" issue in the cookie spec, the introduction of a new header for key exporter in the signature authentication scheme, the media type and upload limits in the resumable uploads draft, and a deprecation request for HTTP signature scheme.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Cookie Spec (6265bis):**
    *   The "same site redirect chain" issue was resolved by reverting the relevant language.
    *   Working group last call planned after updating the IANA section and a few minor remaining issues are resolved.
    *   Discussion about a more continuous evolution of the cookie spec.

*   **Signature Authentication (formerly Unprompted Authentication):**
    *   Interop testing was successful with editorial clarifications and a security review completed.
    *   Proposal to define a new header to send the exporter to the upstream HTTP server. There was much discussion around the utility of this header.
    *   Discussion and bike-shedding around renaming the authentication scheme to avoid collisions, alternatives: "hidden," "masked," "client-initiated", "unprompted" or "signature2".

*   **Query Method:**
    *   The draft has been stalled for a while. A side meeting is planned for Thursday at 5 PM local time to move it forward.

*   **Resumable Uploads:**
    *   Updates in draft version 3 included progress notifications and clarification on the use of empty requests.
    *   Discussion around the media type for patch requests, with a proposal to use "application/partial-upload".
    *   Discussion on upload limits with options for announcing them via new header fields (either multiple headers or a single dictionary header).
    *   Discussion about partial changes on patch requests
    *   Discussion about how content coding should be handled when resuming uploads. Recommendation is to omit the content encoding header upon resuming.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Cookie Spec:** Publish a new draft with the current set of changes, followed by a working group last call (at least 4 weeks).
*   **Signature Authentication:**
    *   Editors to discuss and choose a new name for the authentication scheme based on the working group's input and chair's guidance.
    *   David to incorporate editorial feedback, especially related to the rationale for the approach taken.
*   **Query Method:** Side meeting to be held on Thursday at 5 PM local time.
*   **Resumable Uploads:**
    *   Incorporate feedback on upload limits (optional, using relative times).
    *   Add language regarding the interpretation of "atomic" patch application in the context of resumable uploads.
    *   Deprecate the previous signature HTTP scheme

## Next Steps

*   **Cookie Spec:** Publish updated draft and prepare for working group last call.
*   **Signature Authentication:** Choose a new name and update the draft.
*   **Query Method:** Hold side meeting and make progress on resolving open issues.
*   **Resumable Uploads:** Address open issues and prepare for a new draft release.
