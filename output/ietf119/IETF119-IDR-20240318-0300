## Summary

The IDR working group session covered several draft proposals related to BGP extensions. Key topics included generic metric extensions for BGP, extensions for IPv4/IPv6 mapping advertisements, segment routing extensions, BGP egress engineering, and flow specification enhancements. The session also touched upon securing inter-domain routing with FCBGP and source address validation using flow specifications.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Generic Metric Extensions for BGP:** Discussion focused on introducing generic metric extensions for BGP using the Next-Hop Dependent Capability Attribute (NHC). The goal is to support intent-based end-to-end paths with various metrics like delay, bandwidth, and administratively assigned metrics. Discontinuity issues were addressed, and the use of NHC for scoping was highlighted.
*   **MBGP Extensions for IPv4/IPv6 Mapping Advertisements:** This presentation covered MBGP extensions (6map46) for carrying IPv4 attributes over IPv6 networks to facilitate transition technologies across multiple autonomous systems. Revisions and operational considerations were discussed.
*   **Segment Routing BGP Extensions:** Updates to a draft defining new segment sub-TLVs for providing optional algorithms for SMPS adjacencies were presented. Remote node address interface requirements were clarified.
*   **Segment Routing BGP Egress Engineering over L2 Bundles:** The session discussed BGP peer adjacency segment advertisement over layer 2 bundles for traffic steering purposes. Modifications to existing RFCs were proposed.
*   **BGP Extensions of SR Policy for Head-end Behavior:** This presentation introduced extensions for specifying head-end behaviors for SRv6 policies, including new sub-TLVs for layer 3 and layer 2 traffic.
*   **BTPIs s s as a policy for, PE:** Reporting the Network Resource Partition associated with an SR Policy Candidate Path via BGPLs.
*   **BGP link state For the Advertisement of an RPA information in a scalable way:** NRP is, a collection of natural resources allocated on a set of links in a neural network network.
*   **Dissemination of beach flow stack rules for APN:** Propose a new component type for APN. And, the discussion about flows spec V2
*   **FCBGP:** A novel secure inter domain routing protocol, it has built upon a unified, preventive called the verifiable intent, and it's fully compatible with the BGP and incrementally deployable by offering strictly, positive security benefits.
*   **Destination IP Community Filter for BGP flow specification:** Proposing a new BGP flows by component type. To support the community level filtering.
*   **Beach b flow spec for source address validation:** Extend the flows back to support of mushrooms, interfaces, to used to check The sauce addresses of a package.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Generic Metric Extensions for BGP:** The author requested working group comments and asked the chairs to consider the draft for adoption. Send adoption requests to the mailing list.
*   **MBGP Extensions for IPv4/IPv6 Mapping Advertisements:** The authors will incorporate comments received and refine the draft.
*   **Segment Routing BGP Extensions:** The authors will prepare for a second working group adoption call.
*   **Segment Routing BGP Egress Engineering over L2 Bundles:** The authors will add a header indicating that the draft modifies existing RFCs. They will also sync over and send my response to the mail list
*   **BGP Extensions of SR Policy for Head-end Behavior:** The authors will have conversations with those authors and look at the status of head and insert behaviors.
*   **BTPIs s s as a policy for, PE:** The author will check with T's chair to check applicability is being appropriately met.
*   **BGP link state For the Advertisement of an RPA information in a scalable way:** the author will address and make that clear about the relationship with IGP.
*   **FCBGP:** The author has committed to expanding this section in a future version
*   **Destination IP Community Filter for BGP flow specification:** The author will add a session to describe a flow spike work tool extension of our destination IP community filter.

## Next Steps

*   Authors to incorporate feedback and update drafts.
*   Chairs to assess the readiness of drafts for working group adoption.
*   Continue discussions on the mailing list for clarification and further refinement of proposals.
