# idr Session

## Summary
The IDR session covered several important topics including the current document status, updates on VPN prefix outbound filter (VPNOF), a YANG model for RPKI, BGP extensions for 5G edge services, and a proposal for a packet content filter for BGP flow specification (FlowSpec). The session included discussions on adoption calls, working group last calls, and the planned approach for FlowSpec V2.

## Key Discussion Points
*   **Document Status:** Completed car and CT work, pending working group last call for send hold timer. Working group is planning a call on CPR. Discussion regarding cleaning up old IDR documents without implementations.
*   **FlowSpec V2:** A new approach to FlowSpec V2 development will be adopted, focusing on breaking the larger document into smaller, implementable pieces. This includes basic IP flow spec, more IP filters, actions, and non-IP considerations. Dedicated teams will be formed to discuss each aspect.
*   **VPN Prefix Outbound Filter (VPNOF):** Updates presented including a new extended community for source PE identification and refinements to the processing method of the receipt or I've entry by the receiver and increase to VPN prefix limit length. Two implementations exist.
*   **YANG Model for RPKI:** Four YANG models were presented covering configuration and management of RPKI routing protocols, origin validation, BPsec pass validation, and ASPA validation. Discussion on where this document belongs, given overlaps with side-rep.
*   **BGP Extensions for 5G Edge Services:** Updates on the metadata pass attribute for 5G edge services, including use cases, TLVs, and one implementation report. Discussed the use of route targets to represent groups of services. Discussion around the broadness of the metadata attribute.
*   **Packet Content Filter for FlowSpec:** A proposal for a packet content filter for BGP FlowSpec was presented to mitigate volumetric DDoS attacks. This filter would allow matching on packet content beyond predefined fields.
*   **Review of Prior Work (IETF 110 Slides):** Prior work on position based detection including implementation challenges was presented for context.

## Decisions and Action Items
*   **VPNOF:** Draft added to working group last call queue. Details on implementation report and Shepherd's check to be sent to the author.
*   **YANG Model for RPKI:** ADs and chairs will discuss the document's organization, specifically whether to keep it as a single document or split it into multiple documents.
*   **BGP Extensions for 5G:** Authors to consider adding scoping and applicability guidelines to the draft, and to consider alternative names for the attribute.
*   **Flowspec Teams:** Initial meetings for flowspec teams will be announced.

## Next Steps
*   Authors of the drafts mentioned should address the comments and suggestions from the working group.
*   Interested parties should join the FlowSpec V2 discussion groups/teams.
*   Chairs will schedule working group last calls for approved drafts.
