## Summary
The JMAP and EXTRA working group session covered progress on several drafts related to JMAP (JMAP Sieve, JMAP Sharing, JMAP Contacts, JMAP Calendars, JMAP Portability) and IMAP (IMAP Access, IMAP In Progress, List Message Data, Sieve Process).  Technical discussions focused on clarifying requirements, resolving dependencies, and defining the best path forward for each specification. Several action items were identified for draft updates and further discussion on the mailing lists.  EXTRA adopted a new draft (6855bis) aiming to be compatible with 9051.
