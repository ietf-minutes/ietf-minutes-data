## Summary

The JOSE working group met at IETF 119 to discuss several drafts, including JSON Web Proofs, Fully Specified Algorithms for JOSE and COSE, Use of HPKE for JOSE, a JOSE Cookbook, HOSE/COSE Guidance, PQ CAMS for JOSE and COSE, ECDH-MAC Based Signatures, and Tuition-1 Grain Access. The discussions focused on the progress of existing drafts, potential adoption of new drafts, and the scope and direction of future work.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **JSON Web Proofs:** Significant progress has been made, with normative and editorial updates addressing ambiguities and incorporating recent changes to dependent specifications like BBS signatures and BLS key representations. The group seeks representations for additional zero-knowledge proof algorithms.
*   **Fully Specified Algorithms for JOSE and COSE:** Debate arose around the need to fully specify ECDH variants, given the ephemeral key parameter and the potential for creating numerous new algorithm identifiers. Some argued for fully specifying them to avoid implementation issues, while others suggested focusing on low-hanging fruit and leaving ECDH for a separate draft or potentially leveraging HPKE instead.
*   **Use of HPKE for JOSE:** The draft defining two new modes leveraging HPKE for direct and key encryption is nearing working group last call.
*   **JOSE Cookbook:** The cookbook aims to provide examples and test vectors for JOSE and COSE HPKE, highlighting differences in ephemeral key representation between the two groups. It's intended to facilitate interworking between the groups.
*   **PQ CAMS for JOSE and COSE:** Concerns were raised about adding algorithms solely for the sake of adding them, especially when HPKE offers a path to hybrid and pure PQ schemes. The group discussed aligning with standardized algorithms and minimizing cryptographic invention.
*   **ECDH-MAC Based Signatures:** A proposal for a designated verifier signature scheme using ECDH and MAC was presented, sparking discussion about its applicability to JOSE and potential confusion with standard signature semantics.
*   **Tuition-1 Grain Access:** This work was considered more relevant to the OAuth working group and Jason Web Tokens.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **JSON Web Proofs:**
    *   Continue working through issues and tracking changes to dependent specifications.
    *   Encourage volunteers to define representations for additional ZKP algorithms.
*   **Fully Specified Algorithms for JOSE and COSE:**
    *   Mike Jones will write down what it would look like to specify the new ECDH algorigthms, possible in an individual draft or even just an email to the mailing list.
    *   Discuss the question of fully specifying ECDH variants further on the mailing list.
    *   The esteemed chairs will issue a working group last call after a reasonable discussion of the fully specified variants on the mailing list.
*   **Use of HPKE for JOSE:**
    *   Chairs will issue a call for adoption.
*   **PQ CAMS for JOSE and COSE:**
    *   No action; await further developments.
*   **ECDH-MAC Based Signatures:**
    *   Further discussion on the list.
    *   Paul will investigate and use HPKE and the like.
*   **Tuition-1 Grain Access:**
    *   Chairs will help the authors get the draft in front of the OAuth working group.

## Next Steps

*   The JOSE working group will continue working on open issues and reviewing drafts.
*   Mike Jones will prepare an example for fully specified ECDH variants for discussion.
*   The chairs will initiate a call for adoption for the HPKE for JOSE draft.
*   Follow-up discussions will take place on the mailing list regarding Fully Specified Algorithms and other drafts.
