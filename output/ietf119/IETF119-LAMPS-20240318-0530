## Summary
This LAMPS meeting covered several draft updates, focusing on documents in the RFC editor's queue or undergoing Working Group Last Call. Key topics included header protection, email security guidance, PKIX-related documents, CSR attestation, and CMS-related drafts. The group discussed proposed changes, open issues, and future directions for several documents, with a strong emphasis on aligning work with other IETF groups, especially the CFRG.

## Key Discussion Points
*   **Header Protection and Email Security Guidance:** Discussions centered on case sensitivity in header names within the "HP Removed" and "HP Obscured" header fields.  The consensus was that clarification was sufficient. The group also debated whether the email security guidance draft should be BCP or informational, ultimately deciding to proceed with informational.
*   **PKIX Updates (4210bis):** Hendrick presented updates to RFC 4210bis, including incorporating changes from CMP updates (RFC 9480), supporting CAM keys, and adding a section on CAM-based message protection. Open issues related to mandatory schemas for CMP, root key updates, and potential incompatibilities with password-based MAC were discussed. Concerns were raised about whether proposed changes could imply a requirement to directly connect with a CA.
*   **CMP and CAM related documents:** Discussion on the need for review of the CAM-related parts of the CMP documents by a crypto expert.  The novel approach of establishing a MAC key via CAM for integrity protection was specifically highlighted as needing scrutiny.
*   **CSR Attestation:** Michael presented updates to the CSR attestation draft, focusing on the addition of a "hint" to the evidence statement to aid parsing. He requested feedback on a proposed new IANA registry for tracking OIDs registered in other SDOs to improve implementer awareness. Concerns raised about how OIDs are collected and the process for private OIDs.
*   **CMS-related drafts (Kyber):** A major re-write was undertaken based on RFC 5990bis and aligned with CMS Camry. There were discussions about mandatory-to-implement components, specifically KMac and SHA-2. There was discussion about the use of SHA-2 vs SHA-3 in the document.
*   **Composite Cams:** Discussion on composite CAMS were deferred to a future CFRG meeting. There was discussion about whether or not to move forward with the composites CAMS document and discussion about problems with the current key combiners.

## Decisions and Action Items
*   **Header Protection:** Authors to consider adding a note clarifying case-insensitive comparison of header names in the HP fields.
*   **Email Security Guidance:** Proceed with publishing the email security guidance draft as informational.
*   **RFC 4210bis:**
    *   Authors to bring concerns about the mandatory schema up to the mailing list.
    *   Merge the provided pull request for the update to root key update.
    *   Issue about the size of the key for CRMF was closed.
    *   Merge the pull request regarding the root see a key update content.
    *   Sean Turner and Mike Elsworth will seek out review of the CAM-related portions of the CMP documents.
*   **CSR Attestation:** Authors to refine the proposed IANA registry based on feedback, and discuss with IANA about the feasibility and appropriate process for the second registry.
*   **CMS-Kyber:** Add an "or" operator with justification and let people fight about it. It was decided that both SHA-3 and SHA-2 must be used in the document.
*   **7030 CSR attributes:** Working group last call to begin.

## Next Steps
*   Authors to post updated drafts incorporating feedback received during the meeting.
*   Continued work on implementations and hackathon artifacts for several drafts.
*   The composite Cams draft will pause depending on future CFRG design decisions.
*   The LAMPS working group will continue the agenda in the next session.
