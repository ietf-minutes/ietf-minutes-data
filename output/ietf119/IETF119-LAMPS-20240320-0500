## Summary

This LAMPS working group meeting covered several draft proposals, including mitigations for CMS attacks, updates to CMC, composite signatures for MLDSA, hash-based signatures for X.509, instant messaging EKU, and remote attestation for CSRs. Key discussions revolved around the technical details, potential interoperability issues, security considerations, and use cases for each proposal. A call for adoption was held for the composite signatures draft, and the group agreed to proceed with the adoption process.  Several drafts are candidates for adoption, and the working group has requested OIDs from IANA and has asked for feedback on others.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **CMS Attack Mitigation:** Discussed a draft to mitigate an attack against CMS authenticated envelope data using CCM or GCM by binding the encryption algorithm identifier into the key derivation function (KDF).
    *   Concerns raised on the overhead of requiring HKDF in all cases.
    *   Discussion on potentially updating CMS itself to only support this technique.
*   **CMC Updates:** Presented changes to the CMC draft, including adding HSMAC-SHA2 support, removing TLS 1.0, and aligning agent types.
    *   Question raised on why TLS 1.3 wasn't used instead of 1.2, but the update is following BCP guidance.
    *   Discussed adding support for key agreement recipient info.
*   **Composite Signatures:** Updates on version 13 of the composite signatures draft, including changing the ASCII Duran coded string to a Dur encoded OID and simplifying pre-hashing algorithms.
    *   Discussion about the CMS-specific nature of using a DER encoding of an OID as a domain separator.
    *   Debate on removing some of the supported signature combinations. Suggestions included removing MLDSA-65 or RSA PSS.
    *   Discussion of a prehash algorithm dependency in composite signature happening in a particular layer in the implementation.
*   **Hash-Based Signatures:** Discussed splitting the hash-based signatures draft into two documents: one for stateful signatures and one for SPHINCS+.
    *   A call for adoption was recently started on the mailing list.
*   **Instant Messaging EKU:** Proposed an extended key usage (EKU) for instant messaging to prevent unintended certificate issuance.
    *   Group had no concerns regarding the proposal.
*   **Remote Attestation for CSRs:** Presented a draft for providing freshness of attestation evidence in CSRs using nonces, focusing on CMP and EST protocols.
    *   Discussion around denial-of-service resistance and state management for nonce requests.
    *   Consideration of adding support for other enrollment protocols.
    *   The attester may know the verifier, but the process of passing a nonce may not be standardized.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Composite Signatures:** Based on a show of hands, the working group will proceed with a call for adoption of the composite signatures draft.
*   **Hash-Based Signatures:** Group to express their opinion on the mailing list thread for adoption.
*   **Instant Messaging EKU:** Proceed with a call for adoption of the EKU draft.
*   **Remote Attestation for CSRs:** The WG to conduct a call for adoption.
    *   Address comments on RATS list, and consider the role of the verifier during adoption.

## Next Steps

*   Authors to address comments received during the meeting and update drafts accordingly.
*   Chairs to initiate calls for adoption on the mailing list for applicable drafts.
*   Working group to continue discussion on open issues and potential improvements to the draft proposals.
