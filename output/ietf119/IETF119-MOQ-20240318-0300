# moq

## Summary

This meeting covered several key aspects of the moq protocol, including a review of the hackathon, discussion of subscribe/fetch semantics, updates to draft 3, low overhead container format (LLC), transport issues, and prioritization. A significant portion of the meeting focused on a new proposal for handling subscribe and fetch, aiming to simplify the interaction between clients and relays. The meeting also addressed the need for prioritization mechanisms and the challenges associated with them.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Hackathon Review:** Six implementations were reported, with progress made on draft 3. Efforts are underway to achieve interoperability.
*   **Subscribe/Fetch Proposal:** A new approach to subscribe and fetch was presented, focusing on relative subscriptions for live edges and absolute fetches for historical data.
    *   Subscribe uses relative ranges for subscribing to the live edge.
    *   Fetch uses absolute ranges for fetching historical data.
    *   Delivery order for fetch is *not* guaranteed.
    *   Debate on whether subscribe should include the ability to start at a non-zero object within a group.
    *   Discussion on signaling dropped groups.
    *   Relays should cache at least the last and current group for consistent subscribe behavior.
    *   Discussion of track alias vs. subscribe ID.
*   **Draft 3 Updates:** A review of updates and clarifications in draft 3 was presented, including:
    *   Addition of largest group and object ID to subscribe.
    *   Change to datagram-only mode.
    *   Merging of reset messages.
    *   Addition of announce/cancel.
*   **Low Overhead Container (LLC):** A presentation on a new container format based on WebCodecs intended to have lower overhead than CMAF.
    *   Discussion on separating the packaging container format from the mock streaming format.
*   **Transport Issues:** Discussion on explicit signaling for the end of groups and tracks.
*   **Prioritization:** Detailed discussion of priorities, including:
    *   Challenge to reach a consensus due to conflicting requirements and use cases.
    *   Importance of data-driven decisions.
    *   Debate on subscriber-driven vs. publisher-driven prioritization.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Subscribe/Fetch:** A PR will be created to reflect the presented subscribe/fetch proposal. Luke will provide feedback or propose an alternative.
*   **Low Overhead Container (LLC):** Moe will split the LLC draft into a container format and a separate streaming format, either as separate drafts, or as distinct sections in a single draft. The chairs will decide which approach to take.
*   **Prioritization:**
    *   Revive and update prior work on Prioritization, to reflect current considerations.
    *   The group will use breaks and beverages to discuss prioritization experiments and desired data points.

## Next Steps

*   Create a PR for the subscribe/fetch proposal based on the presentation, addressing feedback from the chat.
*   Split the LLC draft into separate streaming and packaging format components.
*   Address the prioritisation discussion and potential for an interim meeting at the end of the week.
*   The Chairs will decide what specific actions to take once they've received feedback after further discussion on the prioritization issue.
