## Summary

The OAuth working group meeting covered several key topics including Selective Disclosure for JWT (SDJOT), Protected Resource Metadata, Browser-Based Apps, Transaction Tokens, Identity Chaining, and a new draft on Identity Assertion Authorization Grant. Discussions revolved around draft specifications, open issues, and potential next steps, including working group last calls for some drafts.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **SDJOT (Selective Disclosure for JWT):**
    *   Discussion on redesigning the JWS JSON serialization.
    *   Debate around separating the token and presentation formats based on the presence or absence of key binding.
    *   Clarifying algorithms to accommodate recursive redaction.
    *   Reference to RFC 4086 for salt entropy considerations.
    *   Concerns about making claims controlling the validity of the jot itself selective disclosable.
    *   Handling of duplicate digest values and unused disclosures.
*   **Protected Resource Metadata:**
    *   Switched from concatenating `.well-known` to the end of the URL to inserting it in the middle before the path.
    *   Changed the WWW-Authenticate header to return the URL for metadata instead of the resource identifier.
    *   Discussion on whether the draft is ready for Working Group Last Call
*   **Browser-Based Apps:**
    *   Restructuring of the draft to focus on threats to JavaScript apps and patterns for building apps.
    *   Discussion of different attack vectors and the consequences related to different app patterns.
    *   Suggestions to improve the clarity and readability of the text.
    *   Discussion on whether the draft is ready for Working Group Last Call.
*   **Transaction Tokens:**
    *   Discussion on how to manage authorization and transaction immutability within a trust domain.
    *   Moved back to using a standard "sub" claim instead of the "sub_id" from the "set" structure.
    *   Logic added for including the requesting workload when requesting replacement transaction tokens.
    *   Discussion on passing transaction tokens between servers, with options including a new HTTP header.
    *   Discussion on the usage of transaction tokens in long-running batch requests.
    *   Discussion about separating transaction tokens from JWT constructs and the relation to whimsy.
    *   Concerns about downscoping of scopes, for replacement transaction tokens.
*   **Identity Chaining:**
    *   Overview of identity and authorization chaining across domains using token exchange and assertion framework.
    *   Specific steps for identity and authorization training.
    *   Concerns of how to handle Sender Constraints
    *   Claims transcription from one domain to another.
*   **Identity Assertion Authorization Grant:**
    *   Use case involves brokering API access between applications with a single sign-on relationship.
    *   Uses token exchange and the JWT Authorization Grant (RFC 7523).
    *   Explicitly uses identity tokens obtained through a single sign-on flow.
    *   Profile is necessary to ensure interoperability between parties, since the identity training draft is vague.
    *   Discussions on center constraining
    *   Discussion on whether it's based on the identity training spec

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Protected Resource Metadata:** Start a working group last call.
*   **Browser-Based Apps:** Start a working group last call.
*   **Transaction Tokens:** Request for Wimsey Group to review this document.
*   **Identity Chaining:**
    *   Explore adding sender constraining mechanisms (DeepPop, M TLS).
    *   Determine how the AS knows when to generate a JWT authorization grant.
*   **SDJOT:** Richard to review changes.
*   **Identity Assertion Authorization Grant:** Explicitly define the parameters of token exchange in the spec, to ensure that everyone is on the same page.
*   **SDJOT:** Productive input needed on Richard's PR.

## Next Steps

*   Working group last calls for Protected Resource Metadata and Browser-Based Apps.
*   Further discussions and refinements on SDJOT, Transaction Tokens, and Identity Chaining drafts based on received feedback.
*   Continue the development of the Identity Assertion Authorization Grant and monitor the implementation efforts.
