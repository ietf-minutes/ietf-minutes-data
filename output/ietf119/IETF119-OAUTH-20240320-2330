## Summary

This OAuth working group meeting covered several key topics including updates on the SD-JWT VC draft, token status lists, attestation-based client authentication, a nonce endpoint proposal, status attestation proposals, and a presentation on JSON fine-grained access. Discussions focused on design considerations, security implications, and the relationship between different specifications and use cases.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **SD-JWT VC:**
    *   Recent updates and future directions, including a proposal for combining SD-JWT with W3C VCDM to address requirements from the EU Digital Identity Wallet.
    *   Ensuring the specification meets the needs of use cases beyond the EU.
*   **Token Status List:**
    *   Updates and design considerations, including the reuse of the status claim for other mechanisms and the addition of a time-to-live claim for caching information.
    *   Discussions around where the status object should be located (header vs. payload).
    *   Privacy implications and potential mitigations against malicious issuers.
    *   Whether to include a comparison with other revocation mechanisms (CRL, etc.) and if these mechanisms should be combined into one draft.
*   **Attestation-Based Client Authentication:**
    *   Proposals for using the depop for the proof-of-possession syntax.
    *   Discussion on moving attestation information into HTTP headers and concerns regarding squigglies in JOTs.
    *   Question of whether the Deepop key and client instance key needs to be different and if so what impact that might have.
    *   Concerns and counterpoints about client attestation and authentication.
*   **Nonce Endpoint:**
    *   Proposal for a RESTful endpoint for issuing nonces and its potential applications in OAuth 2 and other protocols.
    *   Concerns regarding context and potential over-abstraction of the concept of a nonce.
    *   Discussion on generating high-quality nonces and provisioning by error.
*   **Status Attestation:**
    *   Proposal to enhance the OAuth status mechanism with status attestations to provide dynamic state, and its relationship to the status list draft.
    *   Privacy and security considerations, including offline presentation use cases.
    *   Concerns that the new mechanism will further fragment standardisation of revocation mechanisms.
*   **JSON Fine-Grained Access:**
    *   Presentation of the JSON Fine-Grained Access Control method.
    *   Relationship to other existing specifications (RAV).

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Token Status List:**
    *   Nick volunteered to review the updated draft.
    *   Authors to address the identified open issues and privacy concerns on the mailing list.
*   **Intermeeting:**
    *   Run a Doodle poll to find the most convenient date for a meeting that includes the WG, Federate Credential Management API group and other interested parties.

## Next Steps

*   **SD-JWT VC:** Daniel, Oliver and Brian to involve the WG in design decisions.
*   **Token Status List:** Authors to address open issues and privacy concerns raised during the meeting and continue discussion on the mailing list.
*   **Attestation-Based Client Authentication:** Authors to take into account WG feedback on the use of DPOP and splitting out the mechanisms into headers.
*   **Nonce Endpoint:** Continue discussions with interested parties regarding specific use cases and potential improvements to the proposal.
*   **Status Attestation:** Encourage the group to read the documentation and get involved in discussions about the design approach on the mailing list.
*   **JSON Fine-Grained Access:** Author to consider feedback and related specifications when revising the proposal.
