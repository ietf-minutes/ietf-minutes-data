# OAuth Working Group - IETF 119

## Summary

This meeting covered several topics, including the Trust Device Flow BCP, OAuth 2.1, a profile of OAuth RAR using Cedar policy language, and updates on the Authorization Challenge Endpoint and Global Token Verification drafts.  A new draft idea on Signed JWK Sets was also introduced. The discussions focused on clarifying specifications, addressing implementation challenges, and seeking feedback on the proposed drafts.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Trust Device Flow BCP:**  Reviewers are needed.  Focus is on mitigating attacks in unauthenticated channels by establishing proximity checks.

*   **OAuth 2.1:** Discussed restricting characters in client IDs and secrets. Strong agreement *against* the restriction due to backward compatibility issues and existing practices.  Further discussion is required on encoding. HTTP working group review is desired.

*   **SEDAR Profile for RAVR:** Discussed the applicability of using Cedar for OAuth RAR. Key concerns raised about the relevance of exposing the policy language to the client and its potential use cases. The group generally advised that profiles for access tokens might be a more natural fit, potentially using JWT.

*   **Authorization Challenge Endpoint:** Progress update. The draft proposes a new endpoint for native apps needing to authorize in web views, avoiding the need for workarounds and proprietary mechanisms. More reviewers are needed to look over it.

*   **Global Token Verification:** Progress update. The draft defines a lightweight endpoint for revoking tokens based on external signals. Discussed whether it should be profile of SSF or not.

*   **Signed JWK Sets:** A new concept was introduced to enable validation of JWT issuers using web PKI certificates without requiring TLS. Useful for offline scenarios.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Trust Device Flow BCP:** Issue working group last call, incorporating typo fixes if time allows. The following people volunteered as reviewers: Monty, Dean, Roy, Rolf, Mike, Brian, Richard, Angeli.
*   **OAuth 2.1:** Continue discussion on GitHub and the mailing list regarding character encoding in client IDs and secrets (issue #128). Schedule a virtual interim meeting in June to discuss and finalize open issues.
*   **Authorization Challenge Endpoint:** Seek more reviewers and initiate a call for adoption on the mailing list.
*   **Global Token Verification:** Cast on the list/people that have lined up for implementation work to indicate on why they think this is really useful work.
*   **Signed JWK Sets:** Further discussion on the mailing list.
*   Michael and Yaron to schedule intermeeting in June.

## Next Steps

*   **Trust Device Flow BCP:** Implement working group last call.
*   **OAuth 2.1:** Address the outstanding issues, schedule inter meeting, prepare a new draft by the July meeting, and aim for a working group last call by the November meeting.
*   **SEDAR Profile for RAVR:** Re-evaluate the profiling approach, potentially focusing on access token profiles instead of RAR, and consider using JWT as the base format. Examples need to be non-open banking oriented.
*   **Authorization Challenge Endpoint:** Recruit more reviewers and initiate a call for adoption on the mailing list.
*   **Global Token Verification:** Gather feedback from implementers.
*   **Signed JWK Sets:** Seek community feedback on the mailing list and GitHub.
