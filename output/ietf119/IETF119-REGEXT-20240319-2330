# regext

## Summary
The regext working group met at IETF 119 to discuss the status of existing documents, potential new work, and address administrative issues. Key topics included the internationalized email addresses document stuck in the ISG, EPP extension for DNSTL quotes, GEO feed data in RDEB, RDAP versioning extensions, and new work presentations including restful EPP, transport over HTTP and quick, and a Delek records EPP extension.

## Key Discussion Points
*   **Internationalized Email Addresses Document:** The document is in the ISG queue and has been under review by the art directorate regarding its impact on email support. There were concerns about the extension's impact on the EPP protocol due to its global setting changes. Changes to the document are expected but are believed to be non-material.
*   **EPP Extension for DNSTL Quotes:**  Gavin presented updates including changes to the info command, specifically how TTL information is returned. The document is considered mostly done and will soon be proposed for last call.
*   **GEO Feed Data in RDEB:** Jesse presented updates including the use of web links in RDEB for GEO feed data. The draft has been updated, introducing a `geofeedlink` member with a relation type of "geo" and a media type of "application/geofeed+csv". RFC 9092 based authors included this draft as a reference.
*   **RDAP Versioning Extensions Discussion:** Jim and Andy indicated it is appropriate to have all three of these documents existing, however the specific problem they are trying to solve has not been addressed. There was a call for clearer articulation of how the three documents relate to each other and their individual roles.
*   **Restful EPP:** Martin presented on mapping EPP commands to a restful API. This includes changes to the base XML schema and removal of session-based commands. Concerns were raised about whether this is in scope of the current charter since it modifies the schema in RFC 5730.
*   **Transport over HTTP:** Mario presented a proposal for mapping EPP over HTTP compliant with RFC 5730. It includes security considerations and a call for feedback on the mailing list.
*   **Transport over QUIC:** James presented a proposal for EPP over QUIC. Benefits include faster connection establishment and improved performance. This proposal also raises the question of charter scope, as well as the transport proposals in general.
*   **Delek Records EPP Extension:** Gavin presented a new document for adding Delek records to a domain name through EPP. This is considered an early-stage effort to demonstrate support for Delek and is not intended to be a work item soon.

## Decisions and Action Items
*   **Internationalized Email Addresses Document:**  The document author will provide a revised document that is responsive to comments, and then it will be evaluated.
*   **RDAP Versioning Extensions:** Schedule an interim meeting in April for a technical discussion on the three documents related to RDAP versioning and extensions. Chairs will send a doodle poll to find a suitable time.
*   **Restful EPP & Transport Proposals:** The area director will be asked to clarify whether these transport proposals are in scope of the current charter.
*   **GEO Feed Data in RDEB:** Discuss it on the mailing list whether the Geo feed might also be, you know, of interest to domain registries or perhaps even registries or whatever other sorts of registry.

## Next Steps
*   Revise the Internationalized Email Addresses Document.
*   Schedule an interim meeting to discuss RDAP Versioning Extensions documents.
*   Discuss RDAP geo feed on the mailing list.
*   Evaluate the role of each of the RDAP Versioning Extensions documents.
*   Continue discussions on the mailing list regarding restful EPP, transport proposals, and new work.
