## Summary
The TEAS working group meeting covered a range of topics including packet optical integration, network slicing, and traffic engineering. Discussions centered on applicability statements for existing technologies in new scenarios, gap analysis, and modeling work. There were also discussions around the definition and implementation of network slices and the mapping of 5QI to DSCP for QoS enforcement. Finally, a method to run CSPF without over reserving the bandwidth for the protection of resources was discussed.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Packet Optical Integration (POI):** Discussion on the applicability of ACTN and POI models in IP and optical network integration, particularly regarding inventory, topology discovery, and service assurance. The use of coherent pluggables in routers and the need for end-to-end SDN control were emphasized.
*   **Network Slicing:** Updates on the network slice NBI Yang model, including alignment with RFC 9543 and clarifications on topology-related constraints. Also, discussion was carried on composite network slices, their use cases, and realization considerations in data, control, and management planes.
*   **5QI to DSCP Mapping:** Presentation on a draft proposing examples of mapping 5QI values to DSCP values to provide end-to-end QoS in 5G network slices. Different grouping criteria and their implications were considered.
*   **Topology Filters:** Discussion and call for adoption on the topology filter and topology filter set data model, which is already in use in the NRP Yang model.
*   **MPLS for Callback After Collision:** A method to run CSPF without over reserving the bandwidth for the protection of resources was discussed.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Network Slice Topology Draft:** Update the draft according to option 4. (Connectivity constraints and topology intent in the same draft, different modules.)
*   **Adoption Call:** Chairs will discuss the adoption call. Expect to see a poll on the mailing list for the document on the realization of composite network slices.
*   **Adoption Call:** Chairs will discuss the adoption call. Expect to see a poll on the mailing list for the topology filters document.

## Next Steps

*   Authors to address comments received on all drafts.
*   Working group to review updated drafts in anticipation of last calls.
*   Coordinate with MPLS chairs on overlapping topics.
*   Email status updates from authors of documents.
