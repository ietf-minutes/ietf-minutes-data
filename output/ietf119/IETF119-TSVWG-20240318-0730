## Summary

This TSvwg session covered updates on several drafts, including UDP options, L4S operational guidance, and NQB PHB.  Discussions focused on resolving remaining issues and determining next steps for each draft. The group aims to move forward with working group last calls for several documents.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **UDP Options Draft:**
    *   All identified issues have been closed, with version 32 planned for release.
    *   Lingering disagreements were discussed, including the definition of "unsafe" options.
    *   The group is looking for volunteers to review the latest version of the draft.
*   **L4S Operations Draft:**
    *   The group discussed whether to keep the draft open for further updates based on deployment experience.
    *   Stewart mentioned the importance of L4S deployment in cable networks and the upcoming trial by Comcast.
    *   Martin noted the need to involve the Linux community to get L4S support in Linux.
    *   The group agreed to keep the document open for future updates as new experiences are gained.
*   **L4S Interoperability Events:**
    *   CableLabs announced upcoming L4S interoperability events in April and at IETF 120 in Vancouver.
    *   Kenji asked about how the draft addresses the case when a router has a marking for LFS and then it's going to have another layer of encryption like the GTP, UDP IP for the external.
*   **NQB PHB Draft:**
    *   Bob Brusco's detailed review was discussed, including comments on limiting burstiness and interoperability with non-DiffServ capable domains.
    *   The group agreed to discourage packet dropping as a traffic protection mechanism.
    *   The authors believe they have addressed all comments from the working group last call and subsequent reviews.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **UDP Options Draft:** Start a working group last call after coordination with the editor on the latest version.
*   **L4S Operations Draft:** Keep the draft open and update it with new information from trials and deployments.  Encourage experiments and additional contributions.
*   **NQB PHB Draft:** Start a working group last call.

## Next Steps

*   Working Group chairs will coordinate with editors to initiate working group last calls for the UDP Options and NQB PHB drafts.
*   The L4S operations draft will remain open, and contributors are encouraged to provide updates based on deployment experience.
