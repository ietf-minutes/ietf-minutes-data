## Summary
The TSVWG meeting covered several topics, including updates on SCTP authentication, careful resumption, and signaling intentions to the network. A significant portion of the meeting was dedicated to a design team report on DTLS over SCTP proposals, followed by discussion on requirements for media handling in wireless networks and collaborative signaling between hosts and networks.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **SCTP Authentication:** Michael presented updates to the SCTP authentication draft, focusing on key management, backwards compatibility, and next steps.  John emphasized the need to explicitly state the lack of replay protection for data if it is not implemented.
*   **DTLS over SCTP Design Team Report:** Magnus presented the design team's analysis of three proposals for DTLS over SCTP. The proposals were evaluated based on technical requirements, IPR considerations, and estimated completion time. Key points included Ericsson's preference for proposal B, Nokia's preference for proposal C, and concerns about IPR implications and the complexity of implementing proposal B in the kernel.  The group also discussed the potential need to engage with OpenSSL regarding IPR concerns.
*   **Design Team Requirements:** Sixteen people said they agreed with the requirements from the design team and no people said against it. The working group is going to set those requirements as the basis for doing the work. The design team was closed.
*   **Multiple DTLS Solutions?:** Is there an appetite to work on two solutions between B and C?
*   **Careful Resumption:** Martin updated on the Careful Resumption draft, highlighting recent revisions, Q log support, pending edits, and ongoing unit tests. He requested feedback and implementations from the community.
*   **Media Handling in Wireless Networks:** John presented requirements for signaling to the network regarding media handling in wireless networks.  The discussion focused on metadata for media frames and streams, traffic shaping parameters (burst size, jitter, packet loss), privacy considerations, and scalability. John and other coauthors were encouraged to involve media folks in Eviticore and Mops.
*   **Collaborative Host-Network Signaling:** Ned presented a use case draft focused on collaborative signaling between hosts and networks to address dynamic network conditions. The discussion covered the trade-offs between cost and benefit, operational impact, and security considerations.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Action Item:** Michael to adjust wording in the SCTP authentication draft regarding replay protection.
*   **Action Item:** Chairs to add an item on a list of questions that would help make a decision on the two DTLS proposals (B and C). The action is to help decide which documents to progress to an RFC.
*   **Action Item:** John and Ned to consider producing a common document that talks about the issues of trust with signaling.

## Next Steps

*   Continue discussion on DTLS over SCTP proposals (B and C) on the mailing list.
*   Continue work on Carefully Resumption draft, incorporating feedback on Q log support and unit tests.
*   Continue discussion on Media Handling in wireless network and host-network signaling on the mailing list, and consider producing the suggested joint document.
