## Summary

The TVR working group meeting covered several key topics, including updates on outstanding milestones and documents, requirements for time-variant routing, using ALTO for exposing TBR information, routing considerations for satellite constellations, and a YAM model for scheduled attributes. The group discussed the scope of the requirements document, particularly with respect to multi-domain considerations, and solicited feedback on the presented drafts. Adoption calls were made for both the ALTO and YAM model drafts.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Requirements Document:** Discussion focused on the scope, specifically whether to include multi-domain scenarios.  Assumptions regarding predictable mobility events and changes to addressing were clarified. The document now uses PC language.
*   **Impact on Routing Protocols:** Clarified that the document aims to understand impacts on routing protocols due to scheduling capabilities, not impose requirements on those protocols.
*   **ALTO for TBR:** Explored using ALTO's cost calendar capability to expose time-variant topological information to external applications. Raised questions about the need for a network digital twin (NDT).
*   **Satellite Routing:** Presented routing considerations for satellite constellations, particularly in 3GPP contexts.  Highlighted challenges like dynamic topology, limited bandwidth, and hardware limitations. Focused on 3GPP's consideration that inter-satellite routing is out of scope. 3GPP is looking to the IETF for solutions related to network integration. There was some bandwidth data presented and it was noted that commercial connectivity has been demonstrated from off the shelf 4G/5G handsets, reducing the urgency of the presented problem.
*   **Scheduled Attributes YAM Model:** Updated the group on a scheduled YAM model, incorporating groupings from the IETF scheduled YAM document. Discussed the need to support time zones (UTC vs. more flexible options) and different duration measures. Explored potential for overlapping schedules.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Requirements Document:**
    *   Reinforce the single-domain scope in an early section of the document.
    *   Attendees should read and provide feedback on the requirements document, submitting questions to the mailing list.
    *   Incorporate feedback on the document, paying attention to 3GPP architecture.

*   **ALTO Draft:**
    *   Solicited working group adoption.

*   **Scheduled Attributes YAM Model:**
    *   The authors of the draft will update the YAM model and plan to adopt this as a work group item.
    *   The authors will check the draft with requirements document.
    *   The authors will make the specification more specific.

## Next Steps

*   Discuss assumptions in the requirements document, especially regarding the multi-domain problem.
*   Further discussion is needed on control plane applications, satellite requirements, topology management, schedule identity, and operational considerations.
*   Collect further feedback on the ALTO draft and YAM model draft from the working group.
*   Conduct adoption polls on the mailing list for the ALTO and YAM model drafts.
