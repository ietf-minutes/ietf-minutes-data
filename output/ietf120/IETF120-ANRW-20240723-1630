## Summary

The Apply Networking Research Workshop (ANRW) 2024 kicked off with a welcome message, followed by a keynote from Sharad Gargwal of Microsoft on leveraging AI/ML for 5G and 6G systems. The workshop then transitioned into a measurement session featuring two papers. The first paper discussed the challenges of HTTP/3's Extensible Prioritization Scheme (EPS) in real-world deployments, and the second paper introduced the concept of the observer effect in computer networks and its implications for network measurement.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Keynote (Sharad Gargwal):**
    *   Leveraging cloud scale to overcome limitations of deployed network protocols.
    *   The importance of using off-the-shelf learning algorithms whenever possible.
    *   Mitigation strategies for hallucinations in generative AI models for network management.
    *   High bandwidth, low latency, and high reliability are key challenges in Cloudified Telecom infrastructure.
    *   Traffic engineering and management using learning algorithms to shift traffic from overloaded peering links.
    *   Using AI agents to automate troubleshooting guide execution, reducing downtime in 5G deployments.
*   **HTTP/3's EPS in the Wild:**
    *   Significant heterogeneity in browser and server implementations of EPS.
    *   Lack of full support for EPS by major deployments, creating a "chicken and egg" problem.
    *   Inconsistent application of heuristics and default scheduling behaviors.
    *   Recommendations include full support for EPS, improved developer APIs, further research into loading heuristics, and realistic testing resources.
*   **The Observer Effect in Computer Networks:**
    *   Measurement overhead can impact network performance (e.g., packet loss).
    *   The uncertainty relation quantifies the trade-off between measurement accuracy and network impact.
    *   Introduction of the "observer factor" as a practical metric for evaluating the overhead of measurement protocols.
    *   The observer factor is easy to compute and allows for apples-to-apples comparison of different measurement methods.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Potential Action Item:** Investigate the possibility of standardizing the observer factor calculation to aid in the design of future measurement protocols within the IETF.

## Next Steps

*   The workshop will continue with sessions on routing and congestion, security and energy, and lightning papers.
