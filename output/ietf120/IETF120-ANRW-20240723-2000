## Summary

The Applied Networking Research Workshop (anrw) session featured three presentations covering diverse topics: location-aware advertising in ENICAS IP networks, empirical characterization of Anycast convergence time, and diffusing computation for loop-free short-path routing.  A fourth presentation covered traffic management focusing on Quality of Experience.  The first presentation investigated regional trends and selective announcements in ENICAS routing. The second presentation empirically measured Anycast convergence times from an end-host perspective. The third presentation introduced a new routing protocol, "Dare," designed to improve the efficiency of diffusing computations. The fourth presentation looked at better Quality of Experience traffic management. Each presentation was followed by a Q&A session.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Location-Aware Advertisements in ENICAS IP Networks:**
    *   Observed that 84% of Enicast networks selectively announce at least one Enicast prefix.
    *   Demonstrated that networks often leverage regional providers to connect POPs and end users.
    *   Discussed the need to consider geolocation for accurate routing simulations.
*   **Empirical Characterization of Anycast Convergence Time:**
    *   Found that 80% of prefixes converge within 10 seconds in the Anycast setting, with faster convergence observed when more vantage points are active.
    *   Identified challenges in reverse probing measurements due to load balancing at K-da's arc nodes.
*   **Dare: Diffusing Compute More Efficient for Loop Free Short-Spat Routing:**
    *   Introduced a new routing protocol ("Dare") to improve the efficiency of diffusing computations compared to DUAL.
    *   Discussed how Dare remembers which neighbors initiated diffusing computations, reducing signaling overhead.
    *   Explained that Dare allows routers to change successors at any time, regardless of active or passive state.
    *   A concern was raised regarding interoperability with existing DUAL implementations.
*   **Traffic Management Focusing on Quality of Experience:**
    *   Presented a novel approach to traffic management, focused on the Quality of Experience in real time media.
    *   Showed the need for better collaboration among the actors, in particular the Application and the Network.
    *   Presented concerns with respect to Net Neutrality regulations

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Location-Aware Advertisements in ENICAS IP Networks:**
    *   Future work: Investigate the underlying factors driving the need for selective routing towards regional neighbors.
*   **Empirical Characterization of Anycast Convergence Time:**
    *   Future work: Increase measurement resolution by scanning faster and investigate regional differences in convergence times, including looking at IPV6.
*    **Dare: Diffusing Compute More Efficient for Loop Free Short-Spat Routing:**
     *   Future work: Incorporate "Dare" into a routing protocol for larger-scale simulations and evaluations, and comparison with Link State protocols.
*    **Traffic Management Focusing on Quality of Experience:**
     *  Future work: Explore how to efficiently calculate these spatial complexity curves all the time.

## Next Steps

*   The presenters will continue their research based on the feedback received.
*   Further discussions and collaborations are encouraged on the topics presented.
