## Summary

This meeting focused on several aspects of network resilience and security, including carbon-aware routing with BGP, integrity protection for in-band telemetry (IOAM), security assessment of internet paths for critical infrastructure, and fixes for KeyTrap vulnerabilities. The session covered both theoretical concepts and practical implementation challenges, sparking discussions about deployment considerations, performance trade-offs, and potential improvements to existing protocols.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Low-Car BGP:**
    *   Discussion around the motivation for green routing and how to incentivize ISPs to prioritize greener AS paths.
    *   Metrics for measuring greenness were explored, including carbon intensity and carbon performance ratings.
    *   Concerns were raised about the potential for increased congestion on green paths and the impact on overall network performance.
    *   Question on how carbon intensity values can accurately represent the ingress and egress pairing of traffic through an AS.
*   **IOAM Integrity Protection:**
    *   Several options for integrity protection were reviewed, focusing on GMAC-based methods.
    *   Trade-offs between check-on-transit nodes and zero-trust solutions were discussed.
    *   Performance evaluations of different options were presented, highlighting the impact on encapsulation, transit, and decapsulation nodes.
    *   The use of IPsec for inter-domain use cases was considered, but ultimately deemed less desirable due to potential path changes.
*   **Assessing Security of Internet Paths:**
    *   Research questions centered on the number of fully and partially ROV-protected paths and the impact of a CI's upstream provider implementing ROV.
    *   Method for calculating the security status of a path by combining path finding with ROV scoring and RPKI invalid prefix filtering.
    *   Concerns raised about detecting IP addresses of critical services to improve the effectiveness of the study.
    *   Challenges collecting paths on the data plan.
*   **Protocol Fixes for KeyTrap Vulnerabilities:**
    *   Recap of KeyTrap attacks, focusing on denial-of-service attacks through DNSSEC validation.
    *   Discussion on how short-term fixes address specific attack vectors but may introduce unmatched complexity and performance issues.
    *   Suggestions for long-term fixes: validation budget management, unique key identifiers, and relaxation of absolute specification requirements.
    *   Considerations of how DNS key tags should be generated and how they impact validation.
*   **Unified SAV Framework:**
    *   Discussion around challenges for wide deployment of Source Address Validation (SAV), including technical knowledge, limited open-source efforts and performance concerns.
    *   Presentation of a unified architecture for implementing and emulating different SAV mechanisms.
    *   Evaluation of different SAV mechanisms in terms of accuracy, control plane and data plane performance, and scalability.
    *   Comparison of traditional and new implementations of SAV, such as Enhanced D-South (E-D-South) and traditional D-South.
## Decisions and Action Items

*   **IOAM Integrity Protection:**
    *   The draft will specify option 2 (validation at the end with no header check) because it fulfills the requirement of zero-trust solution.
    *   Explore the use of delegation to remove validator jobs out of forwarding path.
    *   Consider defining option 3 (neighbor validation) in a separate document later.
*   **KeyTrap Vulnerabilities:**
    *   Discuss with protocol designers how to approach KeyTag issues generically.

## Next Steps

*   Further discussion on the anrw mailing list to explore the topics raised in the meeting.
*   Continued work on refining the IOAM integrity protection draft.
*   Investigate practical incentives for wider deployment of UNISAV.
