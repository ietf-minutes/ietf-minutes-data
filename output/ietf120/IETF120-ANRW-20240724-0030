## Summary
This session covered a variety of topics related to networking research. Presentations included measuring content locality, investigating data center network protocols, defending against QUIC handshake flooding attacks using deep reinforcement learning, evaluating BBRv3 in the public internet, using machine learning for network modeling, and exploring the potential of large language models for protocol analysis and diagnostics.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Content Locality Measurement:**
    *   Definition of local vs. external traffic and the three Ps of motivation (policy, performance, persistence).
    *   Methodology involving domain lists, censorship filtering, website hosting determination, and geolocation.
    *   Limitations including website complexity, proxy probe availability, and the "fog of cloud".
    *   Future work: recursive searching, trace route/latency measurements, reason analysis, greater visualization, and increased categorization.
*   **Data Center Network Protocols:**
    *   Investigating protocols for folded clause topologies, focusing on energy, security, and configuration concerns.
    *   Comparison of BGP-based stacks with a new protocol (MRMTP).
    *   Testing using the FABRIC testbed and automation tools.
    *   Future work: a non-IP-based solution backward compatible with IPv4/IPv6.
*   **QUIC Handshake Flooding Defense:**
    *   Presentation of QuickPro, a deep reinforcement learning approach to defend against QUIC handshake flooding attacks.
    *   Use of real-time rate limiting, connection prioritization, traffic shaping, and anomaly detection.
    *   Integration with existing QUIC implementations and future testing against diverse attacks.
*   **BBRv3 Evaluation:**
    *   Evaluation of BBRv3's coexistence with cubic flows and the impact of ECN.
    *   Results indicated unfairness of BBRv3 towards cubic flows.
    *   Suggestion for community consensus on guidelines for evaluating CCAs.
*   **ML for Network Modeling:**
    *   Challenges in deploying ML models for networking due to generalizability issues.
    *   Presentation of NetMosaic, a tool for scaling data collection using public GitHub repositories.
    *   Demonstration of improved generalizability through training with realistic network conditions.
*   **LLMs and Protocols:**
    *   Exploring the use of large language models for protocol diagnostics, testing, simulation, and prototyping.
    *   Challenges including complex fields, encryption, system configurations, security, hallucinations, and efficiency.
    *   Potential use cases, such as feeding traces to an LLM for diagnostics of behavior.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Action Item:** Donesh (BBRv3 presentation) to review the congestion controller working group draft for guidelines on evaluating congestion controllers. (Reese Enghardt offered the reference)
*   **Action Item:** Danesh Sein Ali to look into ECT zero vs ECT one regarding ECN

## Next Steps

*   **Content Locality Measurement:** Future work includes: recursive searching, trace route/latency measurements, reason analysis, greater visualization, and increased categorization.
*   **Data Center Network Protocols:** Looking at non-IP-based solution backward compatible with IPv4/IPv6.
*   **QUIC Handshake Flooding Defense:** Testing against diverse attacks and developing a comprehensive QUIC attack dataset.
*   **ML for Network Modeling:** Develop closed-loop workflows to study how the network conditions affect the data quality and scale data collection for more wrappers.
*   **LLMs and Protocols:** Continued research on diagnostics and continued exploration of different methodologies of leveraging the LLMs for network protocols.
