# detnet Meeting Minutes

## Summary

This meeting covered several DETNET working group documents and related topics. Discussions included progress updates, open issues, and future directions. The main topics were: Raw Architecture, multi-domain extensions, Taxonomy of Data Plane Solutions, C-Score, ED Decarboning, Tiga for, Deterministic Networking for Industrial Operations, and using SRv6 for pre-off functionality in the detnet data plane.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Raw Architecture:** Rescoping to focus on local domains and tunnels within the DetNet umbrella was discussed. The need to address prior comments before last call was emphasized.
*   **Multi-Domain Extensions:** The presentation focused on updates to the multi-domain extensions draft, aiming to broaden the scope from wireless to wire domains. Participants discussed the need to clarify specific data plane solutions and distinguish between inter-domain and multi-domain scenarios.
*   **Taxonomy of Data Plane Solutions:** The discussion centered around the inclusion of reference topologies for evaluating data plane solutions, the need to clarify the characteristics of CNC flows. Unresolved comments from the previous meeting were noted.
*   **C-Score:** The draft is considered stable, and the future plan is to evaluate it with reference topologies from the taxonomy draft.
*   **ED Decarboning:** The update covered enhancements with two-tier schedulers, policing and ingress considerations, and frequency synchronization considerations.
*   **Tiga for:** The draft has been split into two documents (data plane and control plane). BTM/BOMO and timestamp extensions were highlighted, along with encapsulation methods using time-slot ID stacks. Updates on other working groups was requested for further presentations.
*   **Deterministic Networking for Industrial Operations:** This draft discusses the usage of deterministic networks for industry operations and control, focusing on the UNI. A data plane agnostic approach with potential API formats was discussed, along with existing projects that can be leveraged for future testing.
*   **SRv6 for Pre-Off Functionality:** A new DetNet data plane using SRv6 was presented, covering the definition of a new seed format, flow ID and sequence number placement, and SID behaviors. The presentation resulted in discussions about the existing SRV6 working group's related documents, flow label usage, seed compression, and a variety of possible extensions.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Raw Architecture:** Pascal to review and address outstanding comments, including those from November. Send a notification to the list that it has been done, so comment-makers can review.
*   **Multi-Domain Extensions:** Carlos to incorporate comments from the session into the next update, particularly regarding the Control Plane Framework. Additionally he must review the Raw Architecture to make sure that inter-domain issues are captured.
*   **Taxonomy of Data Plane Solutions:** Genu to address comments from IETF 119 in parallel with soliciting more reference topologies.
*   **Deterministic Networking for Industrial Operations:** Investigate related protocols such as RSVP for traffic engineering and carry specifications of flows.
*   **SRv6 for Pre-Off Functionality:** Authors to evaluate differences between this and the replication seed, and explore how they can be combined.

## Next Steps

*   Continue discussions on the mailing list to confirm working group consensus.
*   Presentations on topics will be continued on Thursday.
*   Authors to work on action items and incorporate feedback into revised drafts.
