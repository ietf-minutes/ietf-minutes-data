# detnet

## Summary
This was the second detnet session at IETF 120. The session included presentations on flow aggregation for enhanced detnet, a framework for traffic engineering in enhanced detnet, and MPLS network action for deterministic latency. The discussion focused on clarifying requirements, identifying gaps in existing documents, and coordinating with other working groups.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Flow Aggregation for Enhanced Detnet:**
    *   The draft proposes objectives, requirements, and principles for flow aggregation, applying them to 5GS.
    *   Concerns were raised about interleaving and the need for large-scale detnet support within 5G.
    *   The presenter was encouraged to refine the document to highlight specific gaps in current detnet definitions.
    *   The document may not be a standards-track deliverable.
*   **Framework for Traffic Engineering in Enhanced Detnet:**
    *   The draft presents a framework for traffic engineering to achieve data accusing in detnet.
    *   The presenter was encouraged to provide specific text suggestions to the controller plane framework document to address gaps related to enhanced detnet, queuing solutions, and inter-domain aspects.
*   **MPLS Network Action for Deterministic Latency:**
    *   The draft proposes an MPLS MNA solution to address scaling requirements for deterministic latency.
    *   Concerns were raised about whether the work aligns with detnet requirements and whether the solution is premature.
    *   The authors were encouraged to clearly define the problem being solved and coordinate with the MPLS working group.
    *   The proposal may be pre-mature and depend on an existing gap assessment that is currently missing.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Flow Aggregation Draft Authors:** Refine the document to clearly highlight the gaps in current detnet definitions and the specific changes being proposed.
*   **Traffic Engineering Framework Draft Authors:** Submit specific text suggestions to the controller plane framework document to address identified gaps.
*   **MPLS Network Action Draft Authors:** Clearly define the problem being solved and coordinate with the MPLS working group. Discuss the requirements within detnet WG and potentially separate the document into requirements and solution components.
*   **Detnet WG chairs:** Coordinate with MPLS WG chairs regarding MPLS network action for deterministic latency.
*   **Detnet WG:** Assess which queuing solutions would be desirable for enchanced determinisic networks before data plan specific discussions.

## Next Steps

*   Authors to revise drafts based on feedback.
*   Further discussion on the mailing list.
*   Coordination between working group chairs.
