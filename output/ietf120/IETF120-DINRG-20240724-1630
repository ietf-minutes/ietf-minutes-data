## Summary

The Decentralized Internet Research Group (DINRG) meeting focused on understanding and addressing centralization, consolidation, and fragmentation of the internet. The meeting included presentations on decentralized identifiers (DIDs), DNS-based identities, centralization trends, and the Solid project, followed by a panel discussion on the driving factors of centralization, potential responses, and future directions for the DINRG.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs):** Discussion on the architecture, use cases, and governance of DIDs, verifiable credentials, and related exchange protocols.
*   **DNS-based Identities:** Presentation on the use of DNS for managing identities, particularly in IoT environments, and a new TLS extension for indicating DNS-based identities.
*   **Centralization Trends:** Exploration of the economic and technical drivers of centralization, the role of Moore's Law, and the potential for regulatory interventions.
*   **Solid Project:** Overview of the Solid project, which aims to separate identity, storage, and applications, enabling user-centric data control and data supply chains.
*   **Fragmentation:** Discussion of various definitions of internet fragmentation and its implications for network stability and openness.
*   **Responding to Centralization:** Examination of potential responses to centralization, including regulatory interventions, decentralized applications, and the role of the IETF.
*   **The Role of Human Rights:**  Discussion on the importance of empowering users with legal control over their data through licensing and cryptographic signatures to prevent misuse by centralized entities.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Explore Collaboration with ITU:** Consider collaborating with Study Group 3 in the ITU to gain a better understanding of regulatory perspectives on centralization.
*   **Study Theory of Harm (TOH):** Further research and study of the Theory of Harm as a tool for regulatory intervention in addressing anti-competitive behavior.

## Next Steps

*   DINRG chairs to synthesize the discussions and formulate a list of key issues and a more structured agenda for future work.
*   Share any relevant reports or information on the DINRG mailing list, including the report from the workshop organized by Chitala.
*   Continue the discussion at the upcoming Kronin workshop to have a more in-depth conversation on identified topics.
