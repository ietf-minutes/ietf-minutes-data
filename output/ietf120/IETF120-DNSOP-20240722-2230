## Summary

The DNSOP working group met for its first session, covering updates on active drafts, hackathon results, and presentations on generalized DNS notifies, delegation synchronization, NS revalidation, and secure name server selection. Key discussions revolved around potential adoption of drafts, security considerations, and implementation details.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Generalized DNS Notifies:**
    *   Discussion on using SVCB records versus a new "_desync" record for announcing endpoints.
    *   Clarification needed on the meaning of "notify" in the context of parent-to-child communication versus primary-to-secondary.
    *   Considerations for how registrars might adopt the proposed mechanism.
    *   Agreement that bootstrap notifications should not be treated differently.
*   **Delegation Synchronization via DNS Update:**
    *   Implementations are almost complete in both generalized notifications and the update.
    *   Update is easier in a parent end, because we get a DNS update message.
    *   Desire for working group adoption to further the draft.
    *   Henri hopes to deprecate six-0 algorithm (asymmetric encryption) so bind server won't support it.
*   **NS Revalidation:**
    *   Security benefit comes from the revalidated nameserver being more secure.
    *   Concerns raised about the aggressiveness of the policy needed for real security benefits and the lack of clarity in error handling, especially with failures during revalidation.
    *   The importance of addressing issues where parents and child zone data do not match was emphasized.
*   **Secure Name Server Selection:**
    *   Discussion focused on vulnerabilities in existing NS selection algorithms and potential mitigations.
    *   Concerns raised that the document focuses on implementation vulnerabilities rather than specification issues.
    *   Suggestions to tone down language in the draft because it contains errors.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Generalized DNS Notifies:** Continue discussion on the mailing list, including the name used.
*   **Delegation Synchronization via DNS Update:** Chairs to discuss working group adoption of the draft and schedule accordingly.
*   **NS Revalidation:** The document will be worked on and revised.
*   **Secure Name Server Selection:** Authors to revise document.

## Next Steps

*   Continue discussions on the mailing list for each of the drafts presented.
*   Chairs to schedule a call for adoption for "Delegation Synchronization via DNS Update"
*   Working group's second session on Thursday to continue discussions on remaining topics.
