# dnsop

## Summary

The DNSOP session covered several topics including a discussion on deprecating or updating RFC 7050 related to DNS64, an update on the DNS-based load balancing side meeting, client authentication recommendations for encrypted DNS, and a presentation on a method to prevent zone walking in DNSSEC. The session involved lively discussions and included input from various experts in the field.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **RFC 7050 and DNS64:**
    *   Discussion on deprecating or updating RFC 7050, which defines secure channels in the context of DNS64 prefix discovery.
    *   Concerns raised about the current definition of "secure channel" in RFC 7050, particularly regarding the use of IPSEC or link-layer security.
    *   Suggestions to deprecate DNS64 and update RFC 7050 to reflect modern practices like using encrypted DNS and DHCP/router advertisements.
    *   Arguments presented that DNS64 is unnecessary and causes issues with DNSSEC validation.
*   **DNS-Based Load Balancing Side Meeting:**
    *   Update on the load balancing side meeting, which explored various ideas related to DNS-based traffic targeting and GSLB.
    *   Discussion on whether to focus on internal improvements to authoritative name servers or modifications to protocols between resolvers and authoritative name servers.
    *   Request for suggestions on a name for a new mailing list dedicated to DNS-based load balancing discussions.
*   **Client Authentication Recommendations for Encrypted DNS:**
    *   Presentation on a draft recommending best practices for client authentication with encrypted DNS, particularly in scenarios where the same entity owns both the DNS server and client.
    *   The draft recommends MTLS for client authentication due to its reusability across different encrypted DNS protocols and amortization over connections.
    *   Concerns were raised about user experience and the potential for leaking identity if client authentication is not implemented correctly.
    *   Debate about the scope of the document and whether it should provide specific recommendations or simply document the tradeoffs of different authentication mechanisms.
*   **Zone Walking Prevention in DNSSEC:**
    *   Presentation on a method called "zone hopping" to prevent zone walking in DNSSEC by selectively removing NSEC records for less critical domains.
    *   Concerns raised about the impact of aggressive NSEC caching on the effectiveness of this approach.
    *   Arguments presented that zone walking is not a significant problem because the information can be obtained through other means like passive DNS.
    *   Counterarguments suggest that passive DNS has limitations and that zone walking can expose sensitive domain names that should not be public.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **RFC 7050:** The working group seemed to lean towards deprecating RFC 7050. Tommy Jensen will need to consider this feedback.
*   **Load Balancing Mailing List:** The group will create a mailing list for DNS-based load balancing discussions. A name is required. Suggest possible names on the DNSOP mailing list.
*   **Client Authentication for Encrypted DNS:** Warren Kumari to conduct a poll to determine if this work should be done in DNSOP.

## Next Steps

*   Tommy Jensen to consider feedback on RFC 7050 and DNS64, and determine if deprecation is appropriate.
*   Create a mailing list for DNS-based load balancing, after a name is decided on the DNSOP list.
*   Warren Kumari will present the results of the poll regarding client authentication recommendations for encrypted DNS to the IESG.
*   Fatima Bonas to revise the zone hopping prevention draft based on the feedback received.
