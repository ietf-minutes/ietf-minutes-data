# grow

## Summary
The grow working group meeting at IETF 120 covered several BGP and BMP related drafts. Presentations included updates on BGP OPSEC, BMP JAM module, Peering API, BMP with TLVs, Route Event Logging, BMP filtering, BMP Route message aggregation, BGP RIP statistics, and BMP local rip peer address. Discussions focused on the direction of BCP194, challenges with schema mounts in YANG models, the scope and implementation of the Peering API, and potential adoption of several drafts.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **BCP194 Update:** Discussed splitting the BCP into a slim core document and separate informational drafts for implementation details and terminology. The goal is to create a quickly updatable resource, preventing stale information.
*   **BMP JAM Module:**  Discussed the challenges of using schema mounts in YANG models and the lack of router support. Explored alternatives like versioning or avoiding schema mounts altogether.
*   **Peering API:** Addressed concerns about route server support, authentication methods, and small operator accessibility.  Discussed adding a boolean field for route servers and a "next hop self" field. Yang models and RFC 9234 were brought up.
*   **BMP with TLVs:**  Discussed indexing of NLRI sets and the possibility of nested groups of TLVs.
*   **Route Event Logging (REL):** Discussed the policy discard TLV and referencing the BGP policy model.
*   **BMP Filtering:**  Explored the possibility of filtering post-policy Agri-Being or Adjribout.
*   **BMP Route Message Aggregation:**  Discussed the possibility of packing multiple BMP messages into one aggregated message and explored ways to collaborate with other BMP implementers.
*   **BGP RIP Statistics:** Clarified changes related to routing threshold statistics, ASPATH statistics and RPKI validation statistics.
*   **BMP Local RIP Peer Address:** Updates for including the peer address of the peer you receive the route from in local rib route monitoring messages

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **BCP194:** Move forward with a slim document, kicking out 7454.
*   **BMP JAM Module:** Investigate alternatives to schema mount.
*   **Peering API:** Authors to consider adding boolean fields for route servers and next hop self. Also, author is to look at RFC 9234 and consider the use of BGP roles.
*   **Route Event Logging:**  Authors to look into formatting issues when referencing the BGP policy model.
*   **BMP Local RIP Peer Address:** Working group adoption to proceed.
*   **BMP Local Pass ID:** Issue a working group call for adoption.
*   **All Drafts:** Participants encouraged to review and provide feedback on drafts.

## Next Steps

*   Authors of drafts to incorporate feedback and prepare for working group adoption.
*   Grow co-chairs to close pending adoption calls and facilitate further discussions.
