# httpbis

## Summary

The httpbis working group meeting covered three active drafts: resumable uploads, identifying query results, and cache groups. There was also a presentation about communicating proxy configuration and provisioning domains in the `int` area, and a discussion about it's relevance to the group.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Resumable Uploads:**
    *   Discussion on discovering upload limits upfront using OPTIONS requests and its potential integration with CORS pre-flight requests.
    *   Debate about including an advisory `Upload-Length` header in creation requests to inform the server of the total upload size. Concerns about backward compatibility with existing servers were raised.
    *   Discussion on integrity checks using the `Digest` field and whether its use aligns with the intended purpose of the integrity preference fields defined in RFC.
*   **Identifying Query Results:**
    *   Debate on whether to use `Location` or `Content-Location` headers to identify a gettable resource for a query and it's caching behavior. A proposal to allow both `Location` and `Content-Location` headers, each serving distinct purposes, was discussed and generally favored.
    *   Discussion on whether or not to allow cached query responses to be reused for subsequent requests, similar to the behaviour already allowed with `POST` requests. Concerns were raised around security implications.
*   **Cache Groups:**
    *   Discussion regarding a revision that removes speculative invalidation. A request for review and a call for implementation were made.
*   **Communicating Proxy Configuration and Provisioning Domains (Int Area Presentation):**
    *   Overview of the `int` area document about discovering proxy configurations using provisioning domains. The document leverages an HPS-protected JSON file associated with a way to reach a network.
    *   Discussion on how to handle the `protocol` field, and consider a HTTP-prefix.
    *   Discussion on the two bootstrapping mechanisms, and network discovery.
    *   Discussion about integrating legacy types of authentication, like "unprompt off."
    *   Concern was raised about the use cases for pack files that defines exceptions, and discussed how the document allows the same, through the split DNS config.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Resumable Uploads:** Marius to follow up with Lucas on the use of integrity preference fields. Marius will add a hint about backward compatibility with existing servers.
*   **Identifying Query Results:** Julian and Mike to work on a proposal that defines the behavior of both `Content-Location` and `Location` headers. The chairs will add Mike to the draft's authors.
*   **Cache Groups:**  Working group to review the draft for last call.
*   **Communicating Proxy Configuration and Provisioning Domains:** Consider using `HTTP` prefix to better distinguish it from socks.

## Next Steps

*   Continue discussion and refinement of the Resumable Uploads and Identifying Query Results drafts.
*   Proceed with working group last call for the Cache Groups draft pending review.
*   Follow up on action items and continue work on open issues.
