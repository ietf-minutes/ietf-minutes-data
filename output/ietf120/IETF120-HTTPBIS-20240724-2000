# httpbis

## Summary

This httpbis session covered a range of topics, including security considerations for HTTP upgrade, server certificate authentication, privacy proxy enhancements, cache performance improvements, and resource versioning. Discussions focused on technical details, implementation challenges, and the potential for standardization.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Optimistic HTTP Upgrade:**  Debate over deprecating the HTTP upgrade token in the IANA registry and whether the draft should address this. The group also discussed extending the scope to include HTTP Connect. Recommendations to restrict upgrade tokens to GET and avoid request bodies. Concerns about TLS upgrade token safety and the potential for misinterpretation of TCP streams.

*   **Secondary Certificate Authentication:**  Discussion regarding the ability for clients and servers to agree on the used certificate. The group also addressed the ability to send exported authenticators in multiple frames for HTTP/2 and potential solutions like continuation flags or certificate compression.  A decision to rename the frame from "certificate" to "server certificate".

*   **Privacy Proxy Wrap-up Capsule:** Presentation of a new capsule type to signal clients to switch privacy proxies gracefully during maintenance or resource exhaustion.  Discussions centered on distinguishing between relays and use cases beyond privacy proxies, with proposals to leverage go-away signals.

*   **No Very Search:**  Presentation of the No Very Search header for optimizing cache performance by allowing servers to indicate which query parameters do not affect the response. Discussion included data on performance improvements and potential adoption by CDNs.

*   **Revised Cookies:** Presentation on the Cookie Store and refactoring cookies for better integration with browser specs (HTML and Fetch) rather than describing browser behavior.

*   **HTTP Resource Versioning:** Proposal for a general versioning architecture for HTTP resources, including headers for specifying versions and parents to track history. Discussions focused on use cases like incremental RSS updates, Git repository hosting, and resumable uploads, as well as compatibility with existing HTTP features and potential implementation challenges.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Optimistic HTTP Upgrade:** The group will rework the section regarding TLS upgrade token to avoid strong claims, suggesting it be reworked. Ben will update the text and bring it to the group.
*   **Secondary Certificate Authentication:** The group will follow up on the GitHub issue regarding sending exported authenticators in multiple frames. Decision to rename the "certificate" frame to "server certificate".
*   **Privacy Proxy Wrap-up Capsule:** Discussions to continue and David to modify his draft a bit.
*   **No Very Search:** The group will take the proposal to the mailing list for further discussion, and potential CDN adoption.

## Next Steps

*   **Optimistic HTTP Upgrade:** Ben will update the TLS upgrade token section of the draft.
*   **Secondary Certificate Authentication:** Follow up on GitHub issue and update draft to rename frame.
*   **Privacy Proxy Wrap-up Capsule:** Continued discussion and draft revisions.
*   **No Very Search:** Discussion on the mailing list regarding CDN adoption.
*   **Revised Cookies:**  Chairs to reach out and determine next steps for cookies.
*   **HTTP Resource Versioning:** Participants to review the draft and provide feedback on the mailing list. Michael will consider the suggested framework and testing recommendations.
