# idr Session

## Summary
The IDR session covered several draft updates and new proposals. Key topics included VGPL SR draft status, flow spec V2 splitting, 5G metadata path attribute updates, BGP finite state machine considerations, BFD strict mode, BGP Quick, generic metrics for BGP, SR policy for composite kinetic paths, time range weights for BGP SRV6 policy, and link bandwidth extended communities. A new proposal on Turner Equip Point was also discussed.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **VGPL SR Drafts:** Updates on the four drafts. One draft was removed. Chair reviews are pending.
*   **Draft IETFB, BGP, inter-AS topology 16:** John was requested to review.
*   **Draft IDR 5G edge service metadata:** Shepherds reviewing it and expecting it to be done soon.
*   **Flow Spec V2:** Discussion on splitting the large flow spec draft into smaller, more manageable chunks for easier implementation.
    *   IP flow spec for DDoS as a minimal subset carrying over the V1 actions and filters.
    *   Extended filters including dependencies between filters.
    *   New actions to extend community actions and add wide community actions.
    *   Consideration of packet filters in addition to link data.
    *   Discussion of making component IDs global vs. local to the filter type.
*   **5G Metadata Path Attribute:** Update on major changes, including the addition of an AS Scope sub-TLV to prevent unintended leaking to ASs. The discussion included mismatch checking and route churn considerations. A question was raised about the necessity of applying a new SAFI, for the ingress router and the working group feedback requested on that.
*   **BGP Finite State Machine:** Discussion on the complexity of maintaining the BGP state machine, especially with added features. The conversation touched upon substates, management exposure, and the need for better documentation.
*   **BFD Strict Mode:** An update on the BFD strict mode feature, including sub-states for all the places where we would transition into open confirm. The goal is to ensure proper synchronization between BFD and BGP state machines.
*   **BGP Quick:** BGP over QUIC was presented, highlighting its resilience benefits due to multiple streams. Each stream is per AFI-SAFI, which also helps for prioritization of each of these address families. Detailed finite state machines for the control and function channels were presented. Security and TLS 1.3 were mentioned.
*   **Generic Metric for BGP:** Updates on the draft leveraging the next-hop capability attribute (NHC) to carry accumulated metrics. The discussions included specifying intent with multiple metric types, updating metrics along the path, and detecting discontinuity.
*   **SR Policy for Composite Kinetic Paths:** Discussion about extending BGP to distribute SR policies carrying composite candidate pass information. This information can be used to load balance traffic over a set of sub-SR policies.
*   **Time Range Weights for BGP SRV6 Policy:** The proposal introduces a time-weight attribute in BGP to pre-configure bandwidth resource allocation. Concerns were raised about the relationship with time variant routing and where it should be done (Spring vs. IDR).
*   **Link Bandwidth Extended Communities:** There were two presentations on the link bandwidth extended community with overlapping but different focuses. One focused on moving from 32bit to 64bit bandwidth, the other on the transitivity question of the legacy bandwidth attribute. Discussion focused on interoperability issues and what has already been deployed.
*   **Source Metric Distribution based on BGP in CAS Network:** This solution defines a new BGP address family to dispute the computing service metric information and a variable Lens NRI related to distinguish between key and non-key paths.
*   **BGP Extension for Turner Equip Point:** This proposal is about addressing the traffic scheduling for AI bursts on load sharing individual packets of the same flow which requires reordering based on the Turner Equip Point information from the remote end.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **VGPL SR Drafts:** Authors to address chair review concerns.
*   **Draft IETFB, BGP, inter-AS topology 16:** John to review.
*   **Draft IDR 5G edge service metadata:** Finish shepherd review.
*   **Flow Spec V2:** Continue discussion on breaking up the draft and defining filter chains and action templates.
*   **5G Metadata Path Attribute:** Working group feedback requested on applying for a new SAFI
*   **BFD Strict Mode:** Implementers to make tweaks to the code and verify against the state machine.
*   **BGP Quick:** Specify the QUIC TLS version in the document.
*   **Generic Metric for BGP:** Authors to consider renaming "capability" due to overloading. Address EBGP questions about metrics.
*   **Time Range Weights for BGP SRV6 Policy:** Coordinate with the time-variant routing working group.
*   **Link Bandwidth Extended Communities:** Try to merge existing work for this one. It was advised the EVPN work has real user cases.
*   **BGP Extension for Turner Equip Point:** Clarify the motivation and architecture.
## Next Steps

*   Continue discussion on Flow Spec V2 splitting.
*   Address pending chair reviews for VGPL SR drafts.
*   Implement changes and verify BFD Strict Mode.
*   Investigate QUIC TLS version in the document
*   Address comments on the draft about Generic Metrics for BGP
*   Coordination with time-variant routing WG to align the work for BGP SRV6 Policy weights with the time.
*   Merge existing work on Link Bandwidth Extended Communities.
*   Review architectural impact.
