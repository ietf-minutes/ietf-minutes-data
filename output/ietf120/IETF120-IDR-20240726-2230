## Summary

The IDR working group meeting covered several topics including a report on the interim meeting, FlowSpec, route redistribution, SD-WAN, and B4/B6. A primary focus was on achieving a base FlowSpec with user ordering and dividing the FlowSpec specification into manageable parts. Discussions involved adoption calls, new filter proposals, action changes, and drafts related to redirect. Several individuals presented their drafts and updates, with discussion around implementation details, scalability, and the interplay between different specifications.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **FlowSpec V2 Decomposition:** Splitting FlowSpec V2 into smaller, manageable drafts: IP Basic (minimal subset with user ordering), more filters (dependency filters), and more IP actions (action change).
*   **FlowSpec V1 and V2 Coexistence:** Addressing the coexistence of FlowSpec V1 deployments with potential migration to V2. Recommendation to deploy V2 if not already using V1.
*   **User Ordering and Component Numbering:** Debate on how to number components within FlowSpec and the need for a default sort order, including the possibility of gaps for future insertions. Jeff Haas provided a detailed explanation of why this is important.
*   **INA Registry:** The group had a brief discussion about the registry design.
*   **Filter Dependencies:** Exploration of filter dependencies and shortcuts to improve processing efficiency.
*   **Action Changes and Failure Modes:** Discussing how to handle action failures (e.g., traffic limiting, DSCP marking, redirects) and the potential for "all or nothing" vs. "best effort" approaches.
*   **Capabilities Advertisement:** Discussion on how to indicate which features an implementation supports and how to handle cases where some network portions don't support specific features.
*   **VRF and Data Plane Concerns:** Jeff Haas emphasized that rules should only filter on what is unambiguous in the data plane to avoid a recipe for disaster.
*   **Hardware Limitations:** Awareness of hardware table overflows and the need for predictable behavior, like a notification if programming fails.
*   **SAUO Rule Distribution:** Nang-Gong presented a use case for BGP FlowSpec for source address validation and raised discussion points about scalability and interface set placement.
*   **Packet Content Filter:** Yusha presented a packet content filter for BGP FlowSpec, outlining its use cases and test results.
*   **Route Redistribution and Deterministic Behavior:** Anchor Chen presented on the uncoordinated route selection algorithm in RIP and BGP interaction, aiming to make the behavior deterministic. Jeff Haas challenged if this should be a normative practice for BGP, as implementations exist without the problem.
*   **Multi-Segment SD-WAN:** Chongfen presented a simple extension to BGP for carrying the associated gateway exchange in multi-segment SD-WAN.
*   **IPv6 Transition:** Shia Chongfong updated the BGP extension for IPv4 service delivery in IPv6-only networks.
*   **4P updates:** Guyin Mishra updated the group on updates to the 4P draft.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Working Group Adoption Call:**  IP Basic draft is under working group adoption call. Feedback is needed on the format and dependency chain.
*   **Capabilities:** The working group recognized the need for capabilities beyond the basic specification (V1 + ordering).
*   **List Discussion:** The group agreed that the interaction between BGP and Admin Distance should be discussed further on the list.

## Next Steps

*   Implementers to review and provide feedback on the IP Basic draft.
*   Continue discussions on extended filters and actions to drive adoption.
*   The working group will address capabilities beyond the basic specification.
*   Address and discuss implementation details on the mailing list.
*   Individual presenters to update their drafts based on the meeting discussion.
