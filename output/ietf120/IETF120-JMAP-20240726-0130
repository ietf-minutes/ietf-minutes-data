## Summary
The JMAP working group meeting at IETF 120 focused on the status of existing drafts, expert reviewer nominations, and milestone reviews. Discussions covered the JMAP core specifications, calendar and contacts extensions, web push, essential portability, REST, tasks, and S-MIME sender extensions. The group also planned for future work, including potential new milestones related to JMAP file access.

## Key Discussion Points
*   **Expert Reviewers:** Two new expert reviewers, Hans-Yerk and Arndt, were nominated to assist with IANA registry reviews.
*   **JMAP SIV:** The draft has entered the editor queue.
*   **Web Push VAPID:** The author is unresponsive. The chairs are to contact the author. If unsuccessful, the working group chairs may reassign editors.
*   **Calendars, Contacts and Sharing:** Mostly ready, with a minor edit needed on the calendar draft.
*   **JMAP Essential, Portability Extensions, REST, and Tasks:** Updates are required before moving to working group last call. JMAP Essential may go to last call sooner.
*   **JMAP Tasks Data Model:** Need to discuss with vendors. The chair to reach out to vendors for input.
