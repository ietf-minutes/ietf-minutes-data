## Summary

This LAMPs session focused on composite signatures and KEMs, updates to CMS drafts for post-quantum cryptography, and discussion of a draft proposing extensions to RFC 4210 for root CA certificate rollover.  Significant discussion occurred regarding the composition of hybrid cryptographic systems, including algorithm choices, key sizes, and the necessity of binding public keys and ciphertexts. The potential impact of NIST compliance and the need for interoperability with other standards, such as X-Wing and OpenPGP, were also prominent themes.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Composite Signatures:**
    *   Discussion centered on reducing the number of signature combinations.
    *   Arguments were made for using different parts of the hybrid to accomplish specific goals (e.g., classical algorithms for compliance, post-quantum for security against implementation weaknesses).
    *   NIST's recommendation to use level 5 security was discussed and whether it would be normative guidance or merely advisory
    *   The need to include RSA 4096 was voiced by an implementer due to existing policy constraints.  Alternatives were discussed, including avoiding specifying a fixed RSA modulus size.
    *   Domain separators in composite KEM construction for PEAK-HEX was discussed and whether it should stay distinct from other standards or align.
    *   Whether binding public keys and ciphertexts externally in CMS is necessary was discussed.

*   **CMS Updates:**
    *   HKDF with SHA-2 and KMAC were discussed as potential mandatory-to-implement KDFs.  The consensus moved towards selecting one for interoperability reasons.
    *   NIST compliance of KDF selections was raised as a consideration.
    *   Discussion regarding the malbinding properties of ML-KEM and whether public keys and/or ciphertexts need to be explicitly included in the KDF was led by Sophie. The overall conclusion was that it was probably not necessary.

*   **Root CA Certificate Re-keying:**
    *   A draft extending RFC 4210 with a one-way link certificate-based solution for root CA certificate rollover was presented.
    *   The goal is to support scenarios where entities are unaware of the new root CA certificate or cannot update.
    *   Questions were raised about the novelty of the approach and whether it addresses a real-world problem.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Composite Signatures:**
    *   Investigate whether to align the PEAK-HEX domain separator with X-Wing. (Mail list Discussion)
    *   Determine if brainpool curves can be safely removed. (Mail list Discussion)
    *   Need a proof regarding RSA OAEP sufficiency to achieve desired binding properties.
    *   Investigate Shaw 3 versus Shaw 2 for KDF and whether to include both. (Mail list Discussion)

*   **CMS Updates:**
    *   Determine which KDF to implement (HKDF or KMAC) with a leaning towards HKDF with Shaw2 for compatibility.
    *   Require the private key be transmitted as a seed and not stored as seed, to mitigate malbinding properties.

*   **Action - General**
    *   Generate samples for appendices in implementations.
    *   Slides 7 from Mike's presentation need their own mail list discussion.

## Next Steps

*   Authors to address comments and open issues in the relevant drafts.
*   Continued discussion on the mailing list regarding design choices and potential interoperability issues.
*   Determine if a separate document for ML-DSA implementation in CMS needs to be drafted.
