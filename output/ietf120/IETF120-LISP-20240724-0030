## Summary

The LISP working group meeting covered the status of several drafts, including LISP Traffic Engineering, LISP Name Encoding, LISP Geo Coordinates, Reliable Transport, and the YANG model. Presentations were given on the Reliable Transport and YANG model drafts, and discussions focused on capabilities exchange for reliable transport, terminology consistency, and the need for clearer state machine descriptions. The group also discussed the future direction of multicast documents and individual submissions.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **LISP Traffic Engineering (TE):** Working group last call to be initiated after the meeting.
*   **LISP Name Encoding:** Stuck in the IESG due to concerns about ASCII vs UTF-8 encoding. No clear resolution on the correct UTF-8 reference. Jim will address it during the next telechat.
*   **LISP Geo Coordinates:** Ready for working group last call after IANA registration is addressed. Discussion about the terminology "GeoPoint" and the purpose of the reserved flag.
*   **Reliable Transport:** Mark presented updates based on Luigi's review. Key points included:
    *   The use of the R bit to signal intent for reliable transport.
    *   Potential "serialization delay" due to protocol negotiation.
    *   Discussion about the need for a capability exchange mechanism, potentially using bits to indicate supported protocols (TCP, QUIC, multicast QUIC). The group agreed to bring this up on the mailing list.
    *   Concerns about the use of the terms "withdrawal" and "rejection," potentially implying authoritative role transfer. The authors will clarify the examples in the draft.
    *   Clarification on registration refresh messages.
    *   Difficulty in understanding the state machine description. Request for examples of well-described state machines in RFCs.
    *   Whether to request registries for message codes.
*   **YANG Model:** Rashad presented an update on comments received. Plan to address the comments ASAP. Suggestion to couple YANG review with other document reviews.
*   **Multicast:** Dino provided an update on the standards track documents and several individual submissions. Discussed the relationship between RFC 6831, 8378, and the new group mapping document. Proposal to make the "VDAS" group mapping draft a working group document (experimental RFC).
*   **Individual Drafts (Dino):** Lispers.net is under IC review. LISP Decent is fading away. The telemetry and mobile network drafts will expire. Looking for guidance on the satellite network draft.
*   **Future LISP Documents:** Call for resubmission of LISP Mobile Nodes, VPN, and LISP Perspective drafts.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **LISP TE:** Initiate working group last call.
*   **LISP Name Encoding:** Jim to address the UTF-8 reference issue during the next telechat.
*   **LISP Geo Coordinates:** Kiran to update the shepherd document to reflect IANA status. Initiate working group last call.
*   **Reliable Transport:**
    *   Authors to update version 5 based on discussion.
    *   Authors to solicit feedback on capability exchange and protocol selection (bits vs. capability exchange) on the mailing list.
    *   Authors to clarify the use of "withdrawal" and "rejection" in the document and extend examples.
    *   Authors to improve the state machine description, seeking examples from other RFCs.
    *   Luigi to suggest whether to request registries for message codes.
*   **YANG Model:** Alberta and Rashad to address comments.
*   **Multicast:** Chairs to decide whether to issue working group document call for the two BIS drafts (6831, 8378) and new VDAS draft serially, over the coming weeks.
*   **Satellite Draft:** The working group will consider including this in the document about use cases.
*   **Dino:** Dino to request reviews on the mailing list for the three Multicast drafts.

## Next Steps

*   Initiate working group last calls for LISP TE and LISP Geo Coordinates.
*   Address UTF-8 encoding issue in LISP Name Encoding.
*   Update Reliable Transport draft based on discussion.
*   Address comments on the YANG Model draft.
*   Evaluate multicast document requests and schedule.
