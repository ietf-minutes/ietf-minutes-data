## Summary
This mimi working group meeting covered several key topics, including discovery requirements, room policy, and metadata privacy. The discussion on discovery requirements focused on authenticating mappings, user preferences, and the discovery protocol itself. The room policy segment introduced an attribute-based access control system. The metadata privacy discussion centered around a proposal for a two-level design, balancing functionality and privacy.

## Key Discussion Points
*   **Mimi Discovery Requirements:**
    *   The discussion covered verifiable mappings between cross-service identifiers (CSI) and messaging service providers (MSP).
    *   Concerns were raised about preventing false positives and false negatives in discovery assertions.
    *   User preferences and how they should be handled, especially regarding multiple mappings and service selection, were discussed, with the current approach punting the majority of that decision to implementation.
    *   The discovery protocol requirements covered request format, processing, and response structure, sparking a discussion on preference handling and the trustworthiness of discovery providers.
    * Timeliness for mappings, especially around number re-assignment.
*   **Mimi Room Policy:**
    *   An attribute-based access control model was presented for managing room properties and access.
    *   Examples of different policies (strict administration, cooperative, moderated) were given, highlighting the flexibility of the proposed system.
    *   Concerns were raised about user impersonation.
*   **Metadata Privacy:**
    *   A proposal for a two-level design was presented: a baseline with clients and hub servers, and an optional pseudonymous version.
    *   The discussion included tradeoffs between functionality and privacy, especially regarding ban enforcement and external joins.
    *   The role of the hub provider in policy enforcement and potential delegation to external entities was discussed.
    *   The tree wrap idea for encrypting the ratchet tree was also touched upon.
    *   The discussion centered on which approach between pseudonym based or encrypted handshake messages was most appropriate and whether deciding on a baseline and an optional add-on were two separate questions or should be decided on at the same time.

## Decisions and Action Items
*   **Metadata Privacy:** The working group decided to proceed with the two-level design proposal for metadata privacy, with a baseline using semi-private messages to the hub server and an optional pseudonymous extension. Further confirmation will be conducted on the mailing list. The group will work on specifications for both.

## Next Steps
*   Confirm the metadata privacy decision on the mailing list.
*   Develop separate documents for the base protocol (including semi-private messages) and the pseudonymous extension.
*   Resume interim meetings in late August or early September.
*   Continue discussion on discovery requirements.
*   Reading and reviewing the current drafts and providing feedback to the mailing list.
