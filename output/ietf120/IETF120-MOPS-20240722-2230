## Summary
The Media Operations (MOPS) working group meeting covered updates on working group documents, an overview of the Media over Quick (MoQ) working group, an analysis of Real-Time Communication (RTC) application protocol usage, and the operational impacts of network overlays on media platforms. The meeting concluded with a discussion about adopting a draft outlining these impacts within the MOPS working group.

## Key Discussion Points
*   **Working Group Document Updates:**  Updates were provided on the status of the extended reality application use case document and the Treatian document, both progressing through the RFC Editor and IESG queues respectively.
*   **MoQ Update (Alan Frindell, Meta):**
    *   MoQ aims to unify low-latency video conferencing and high-scalability live streaming using Quick and WebTransport.
    *   Key components include Media Over Quick Transport (pub-sub), low overhead container format, and a catalog for manifest-like functionality.
    *   Design decisions include an object model (tracks, groups, objects), relay architecture, and transport mapping flexibility (streams vs. datagrams).
    *   Prioritization mechanisms involve subscriber and publisher input, inter-track and intra-track (fidelity vs. freshness) priorities.
    *   Multiple implementations are in development, with interoperability events planned.
*   **Analysis of RTC Application Protocol Usage (Wu, Penn, Peking, Zau):**
    *   RTC applications often deviate from RFC standards, using proprietary extensions and multiplexing protocols.
    *   FaceTime, Discord, Zoom, Messenger, and WhatsApp were analyzed on iOS.
    *   Key findings include protocol multiplexing in a single UDP session (Quick, RTP, STUN), proprietary RTP header extensions, filler packets (Zoom), and custom STUN implementations.
    *   Messenger was found to be closest to RFC standards.
    *   The lack of standards compliance hinders code sharing, monitoring, and research.
*   **Operational Impacts of Network Overlays (Glenn Deen, Comcast):**
    *   Network curabilizations (e.g., Apple Private Relay) modify network policies (DNS, routing) and affect CDN cache selection, geolocation, and authentication.
    *   Changes in routing paths introduce latency, conflicting with the demand for low-latency live sports streaming.
    *   Applications often lack transparency regarding the network policies applied by overlays.
    *   Potential mitigation strategies include best practices guides, studies on the operational impact of privacy enhancements, and collaboration with other working groups.
    *   HTTP vs. HTTPS routing differences were discussed, with emphasis on the potential for unexpected behavior due to Private Relay applying only to HTTP in some cases.
    *   The importance of both platform and network overlay implementers to follow standards for media transport and peering was discussed.

## Decisions and Action Items
*   **MOPS Working Group Adoption:** The MOPS working group agreed, via a show of hands, to adopt the draft on unexpected consequences of network overlays as a work item to flush out the list of consequences.

## Next Steps
*   Glenn Deen will continue working on the "Unexpected Consequences of Network Overlays" draft, incorporating feedback from the MOPS working group and potential co-authors.
*   Explore further collaboration with other relevant IETF working groups to address the challenges posed by network overlays.
