# moq

## Summary

This session covered several key aspects of the Media over QUIC (moq) protocol, including Warp updates, diagnostic reporting, a proposed object model enhancement ("Peeps"), and track switching. Discussions focused on refining the protocol's object model, enhancing its efficiency, and addressing real-world implementation challenges. The session ended with administrative announcements about upcoming interims.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Warp Update:** Discussion on compartmentalization and how it splits things up, overview of the Lock packaging and Timeline Tracks PRs. Issues remaining with Warp.
*   **Diagnostic Reporting:** Discussion on sending diagnostic information like metrics and logging over moq tracks instead of HTTP. Concerns were raised about shared congestion context.
*   **Peeps Proposal:** Presentation of a new layer of hierarchy between groups and objects to improve stream mapping and temporal scalability.  Strong interest expressed by attendees in seeing a PR for this work. Discussion on implications to stream and group handling.
*   **Track Switching:** Presentation of a solution for seamless track switching under congested scenarios, suggesting that the end subscriber hints to the relay.  Alternative suggestions were given on how to make this work with existing APIs.
*   **Missing Objects:** Discussion on whether missing objects should be required, touching on implications for caching and fetch vs subscribe.
*   **Subscribe Limits:** Consideration of limiting the number of concurrent subscriptions. Trade-offs between quick-style max subscriptions and stream-per-subscription approaches were discussed.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Warp Adoption:** Will to ask for adoption of Warp draft prior to the interim.
*   **Mo Zanaty Action:** Mo to send an email identifying communities to include in future moq discussions regarding media formats.
*   **Peeps PR:** Martin Duke to write a PR based on the "Peeps" proposal.
*   **In-Person Interim:** Attempt to find a venue in New York City. If not, the interim will be held in Cambridge, MA.

## Next Steps

*   Continue discussions on diagnostic reporting, track switching, missing objects, and subscribe limits on the mailing list.
*   Prepare and review PRs for Warp updates and the "Peeps" proposal.
*   Determine the venue for the in-person interim in October.
*   Virtual interims will be bi-weekly for August, then return to weekly in September. Next virtual interim will be August 7th.
