## Summary
The NMOP working group met to discuss several key projects, including Yang Push integration, network anomaly terminology and framework, digital map deployment, and operator requirements updates. Discussions covered progress, open issues, and future directions for each project. Decisions were made regarding the scope of the network incident terminology draft and the adoption of the network anomaly architecture document.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Yang Push Integration:**
    *   Updates on the architecture for Yang Push to Message Broker Integration were presented.
    *   The relationship between different Yang Push enhancements and addressing Yang specification gaps were discussed.
    *   Sequence numbers and their relevance to the messaging layer were debated.
    *   Interoperability and hackathon contributions were highlighted.
*   **Network Anomaly Terminology:**
    *   The scope of the network incident terminology draft was discussed, focusing on whether to limit it to the network layer.
    *   The consumer of the terminology work was debated, considering IETF-wide use and harmonization with other bodies like ITIL.
    *   Agreement was reached to scope the terminology draft down to the network layer.
*   **Network Anomaly Framework:**
    *   An architecture document for a network anomaly detection framework was presented.
    *   The importance of labeled datasets for sharing data between network operators, vendors, and academia was highlighted.
    *   The network anomaly lifecycle (detection, validation, refinement) was described.
    *   There was a discussion of the need for a label store to implement the anomaly lifecycle.
*   **Digital Map:**
    *   The Digital Map Concept Draft was presented, focusing on its relationship to the digital twin and identifying requirements and use cases.
    *   The draft's focus on topology modeling was discussed, with suggestions to broaden the scope to include other use cases, such as service assurance.
    *   The poll on the objective of having it as an RFC was run again.
*   **Operator Requirements (RFC 3545 Update):**
    *   The progress on updating RFC 3545 to reflect current operator requirements was discussed.
    *   An upcoming IAB workshop on the topic was introduced.
    *   The working group debated whether to adopt the current draft or wait for the IAB workshop's outcome.
*    **Knowledge Graph For Yang:**
    *    Introduction of Knowledge Graph for Yang based network management.
    *    Applications of Knowledge Graph.
    *    Challenges should be addressed in order to improve the adoption of knowledge crafts for naval management.
*   **Interim Meetings:**
    *   The need for additional interim meetings was discussed, specifically for digital maps and network anomaly.
    *   Alternatives like weekly/monthly WebEx meetings were considered.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Decision:** Scope the network incident terminology draft to the network layer.
*   **Decision:** Adopt the anomaly architecture document as a working group document.
*   **Action Item:** Present the status of the RFC345b in the next meeting.
*   **Decision:** Hold and individual draft the document about RFC 3545.

## Next Steps

*   Authors to address comments and feedback received on all documents.
*   Continue discussions on the digital map and modeling approaches.
*   Prepare for the September 11th interim meeting on network anomaly.
*   Consider additional interim meetings or regular web conferences for digital map and other topics.
*   Explore hackathon implementation for knowledge graphs.
