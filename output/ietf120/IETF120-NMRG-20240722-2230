## Summary
The Network Management Research Group (NMRG) session featured presentations on network digital twins, knowledge graphs for network management, and network systems for AI services. The session covered ongoing work, challenges, and potential future directions for research in these areas.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Network Digital Twins:**
    *   Challenges in designing and operating network digital twins were discussed, including scalability, accuracy, diverse user needs, and parallelism.
    *   A prototype static test system based on SDN was presented, demonstrating snapshot-based network modeling.
    *   The importance of model verification, especially for AI-based models, was highlighted.
    *   Debate over whether to keep the implementation example in the NDT Architecture document or move it to a new document
    *   Security aspects of NDTs, including potential threat vectors and the need for a holistic, system-level approach, were emphasized.
*   **Knowledge Graphs for YANG-based Network Management:**
    *   Knowledge graphs were proposed as a way to integrate heterogeneous data sources in network management.
    *   Key challenges identified included ontology development, scalability, and real-time use cases.
    *   Potential applications included service assurance, network digital twins, and data manifests.
*   **Network Systems for AI Services:**
    *   The presentation focused on the network system aspects of providing optimal AI services.
    *   Considerations for hardware characteristics, model characteristics, and communication methods were discussed.
    *   Use cases included self-driving cars and integration with network digital twins.
    *   Debate over whether the scope of the document should remain the same.
*   **General Items**
    *   The group was urged to provide feedback on the ongoing surveys being conducted in the mailing lists, and specifically related to 'green networking'
    *   The Applied Network Research Workshop (ANRW) that would take place tomorrow was announced
    *   Participants were reminded of the IETF's intellectual property rights disclosure rules, privacy policy, and code of conduct.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **NDT Architecture Document:**
    *   The chairs will initiate a call for research group consensus on the future of the NDT Architecture document, including whether to split the document or not. Timeline will be in advance of the next IETF.

*   **Action Items:**
    *   Authors of the NDT papers to collaborate further on feedback to the work presented today.
    *   Participants to share experience on scalability and other issues regarding NDTs on the mailing list.
    *   Participants to submit reviews of the current draft of the NDT Architecture document.
    *   Jungen to link the AI in Network Systems draft to the main research challenges document
    *   Chairs to investigate feedback and interests from the groups, in particular in light of existing references in other document, and the timeline, and to come back with feedback

## Next Steps

*   Continued discussion and feedback on the mailing lists.
*   Further development of prototypes for knowledge graphs and network digital twins.
*   Addressing the challenges identified in the presentations and discussions.
*   The second NMRG session this week will discuss intern-based networking, as well as discuss the research agenda.
