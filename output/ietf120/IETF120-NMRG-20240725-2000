## Summary
The Network Management Research Group (NMRG) meeting at IETF 120 focused on several key areas, including updates on ongoing drafts, discussions about an upcoming IAB workshop on network management operations (Nemops), and a detailed review of the NMRG's research agenda. Presentations were given on intent-based networking use cases, specifically concerning green services and interconnection, and the group discussed methodologies for building intent-driven networking systems. A significant portion of the meeting was dedicated to evaluating the group's research direction, the types of outcomes it produces, and potential improvements to its working methods.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **IAB Workshop on Nemops:** Benoit presented information about an upcoming IAB workshop focused on the next era of network management operations (Nemops). The workshop aims to update RFC 3535 by collecting updated operator requirements for IETF network management solutions. The discussion highlighted the need for outreach to operators and documenting their needs.
*   **Intent for Green Services:** Luis presented a draft on intent for green services, allowing customers to express their design intents in terms of green service objectives. Attributes discussed included energy consumption, energy efficiency, carbon emissions, and the use of renewable energy.
*   **Interconnection Intent:** Luis provided an update on the interconnection intent draft, extending the notion of interconnection beyond simple IP traffic interchange to include resource and function trading. This draft included scenarios for the Edge-Cloud continuum and lessons learned from implementations.
*   **IBM Use Cases:** John presented an update on the use cases draft, which consolidates use cases from NMRG and other groups like OPSA WG. It summarizes practical learnings and identifies research directions for intent-driven networking.
*   **Research Agenda Discussion:** The group discussed the NMRG's research agenda, including topics like AI, digital twins, green networking, and IBM. The discussion focused on the type of outcomes the group produces (drafts vs. other forms), the approaches used, and how to increase the research focus. The group agreed that it should act less like a working group and focus more on understanding and experimentation.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **IAB Workshop on Nemops:** Participants encouraged to contribute to the workshop and engage with operator and researcher colleagues.
*   **Green Services Intent:** Solicit feedback on the draft and explore synergies with other green networking efforts.
*   **IBM Use Cases:** Refine the use cases document, incorporating practical learnings from individual cases. Consider adding an appendix with examples of intent-to-policy mapping engines.
*   **Research Agenda:** A revised research agenda will be circulated for further input, with a focus on identifying clear research questions and priorities.
*   **Future Meeting Topics:** Call for topics for IETF 121, with an emphasis on emerging areas and external participation.

## Next Steps

*   Circulate the revised research agenda draft for further input.
*   Continue implementation work on intent-based networking use cases.
*   Plan outreach activities for the Nemops workshop.
*   Explore potential collaborations with academic journals and conferences to increase visibility and attract researchers.
