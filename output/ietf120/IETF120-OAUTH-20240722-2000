## Summary

This OAuth working group meeting covered several topics, including SD-JOT, SD-JOT-based Verifiable Credentials, Transaction Tokens, OAuth for First Party Apps, Client ID Metadata, and Encrypted Authorization Response. Discussions included updates on draft specifications, open issues, potential security concerns, and future directions.  The group agreed to a working group last call for the SD-JOT draft.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **SD-JOT:**
    *   Clarified distinction between SD-JOT and SD-JOT plus KB.
    *   Provided ABNF notation for SD-JOT and related parts.
    *   Updated structure for JSON serialization (JIS).
    *   Discussed privacy impacts, particularly the visibility of disclosed information and location.
*   **SD-JOT-based Verifiable Credentials:**
    *   Described the data format and validation rules for expressing verifiable credentials with JSON payloads, with and without selective disclosure using SD-JOT.
    *   Introduced the concept of typing metadata for individual verifiable credential types, including schema documents and display information.
    *   Highlighted the importance of alignment with query languages for requesting specific claims.
    *   Addressed media type conflicts with W3C's verifiable credentials working group.
*   **Transaction Tokens:**
    *   Explained the purpose of transaction tokens for representing work that needs to be done across multiple workloads.
    *   Clarified the valid scope of transaction tokens within a logical trust domain.
    *   Discussed privacy considerations related to transaction details.
    *   Addressed modifications and replacements of transaction tokens.
    *   Clarified the role of the audience claim in representing the trust domain.
    *   Debated the use of self-signed JWTs as subject tokens for internal requests.
    *   Addressed the usage of the authorization details (AZD) claim.
    *   Discussed the requirement of a valid transaction identifier (TXN) in the token.
*   **OAuth for First Party Apps:**
    *   Addressed the problem of developing first-party apps with a better user experience.
    *   Introduced the Authorization Challenge endpoint.
    *   Addressed the use of this mechanism in the context of credential or verifiable credential world for presentation of a credential during issuance code flow.
*   **Client ID Metadata Document:**
    *   Addressed the need for a better mechanism for clients to register themselves with OAuth authorization servers.
    *   Proposed a new method to define a client ID by publishing metadata on web servers.
    *   Discussed various security implications of arbitrary client ID retrieval over the internet.
*   **Encrypted Authorization Response:**
    *   Discussed the possibility of encrypting the authorization response to avoid the round trip to the token endpoint.
    *   Identified several security concerns including credential leakage, access token injection, redirect URI validation, and refresh token fraud.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **SD-JOT:** Start working group last call next week.
*   **OAuth for First Party Apps:** Call for adoption passed, follow up on the list next week. Publish revised draft with 00 version.
*   **Client ID Metadata Document:** Add restriction that all hostnames in the metadata document match the hostname of the document itself.
*   **Encrypted Authorization Response:** Peter Kasselman may write up an individual draft.

## Next Steps

*   SD-JOT authors to initiate working group last call and address any editorial comments as feedback.
*   OAuth for First Party Apps authors to follow up on the mailing list regarding adoption and publish a revised draft.
*   Client ID Metadata Document authors to incorporate the security concerns in the existing draft.
*   Continue discussions on open issues and solicit feedback from the community.
