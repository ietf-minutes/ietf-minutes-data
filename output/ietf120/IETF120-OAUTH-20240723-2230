## Summary

The OAuth working group held a meeting to discuss several draft specifications related to OAuth 2.0. The topics included identity and authorization chaining across domains, an OAuth profile for open public clients, and status attestations for verifiable credentials. The discussions focused on the technical details, security considerations, and potential adoption of these specifications.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Identity Assertion Authorization Grant Profile:** Aaron Paragi presented a profile of the identity and authorization chaining draft, focusing on enterprise use cases where applications need to access data from each other. The profile uses token exchange with an identity assertion (ID token or SAML assertion) to obtain a JOT authorization grant, which is then used to get an access token from the target application. Key discussion points included:
    *   Binding the JOT authorization grant to the client.
    *   Scope requests in token exchange.
    *   Clarifying the subject identifier in the JOT.
    *   Security implications of minting authorization grants.
*   **OAuth Profile for Open Public Clients:** Neil presented a draft specification for an OAuth profile intended for native clients (e.g., email and calendar applications). It aims to standardize OAuth usage in scenarios where username/password authentication is currently prevalent. Key discussion points included:
    *   The use of dynamic client registration (DCR). Some participants expressed concerns about the complexity and lack of proven implementations of DCR. A suggestion was made to use a well-known client ID instead.
    *   The target audience of the profile (native apps vs. web apps).
    *   Security considerations related to allowing any client to access user mail.
    *   The relationship to existing work on email and OAuth.
*   **Status Attestations for Verifiable Credentials:** Leif presented work by Giuseppe on a method for checking the status of digital credentials, similar to OCSP for X.509 certificates. The holder of the credential requests the status directly from the issuer. Key discussion points included:
    *   Whether a credential can have multiple statuses simultaneously.
    *   How to verify the status of a credential at a specific point in time.
    *   The relationship to the existing status list draft.
    *   Privacy implications of leaking credential use to the issuer.
    *   The need for authentication of the requester.
    *   Stapling status attestations to credentials.
    *   Compatibility with zero-knowledge proofs.
*   **Identity and Authorization Chaining Across Domains:** Brian, presented the document on OAuth identity and authorization change across domains. Focus was on discussion on sender constrained tokens. Key discussion points included:
    *   Checking the binding on the inbound token of token exchange
    *   The impact that the AS acting as client throws into the works.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **OAuth Profile for Open Public Clients:** It was decided that it was premature to adopt the draft. It was decided to keep the discussion going. Hannes suggested scheduling an interim virtual meeting to further discuss the topic, involve more people, and get relevant players together.
*   **Status Attestations for Verifiable Credentials:** Leif and Giuseppe will continue working on the draft, addressing the open issues and incorporating feedback from the working group. There are ongoing discussions around including depop binding. 
*   Brian will work on pull requests regarding depop sender constraining, and key constraining.

## Next Steps

*   The OAuth working group will schedule an interim virtual meeting to continue the discussion on the OAuth profile for open public clients.
*   Leif and Giuseppe will continue to develop the status attestations draft and aim for working group adoption after addressing the outstanding issues.
*   The various groups with draft publications should make sure to reference existing work.
