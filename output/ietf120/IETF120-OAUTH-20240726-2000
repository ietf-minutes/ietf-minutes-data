## Summary

This meeting covered several key topics in the OAuth working group, including updates on attestation-based client authentication, token status lists, FedCM integration with OAuth, PICA (Proof of Issuer Key Authority) for offline key validation, and a proposed OAuth profile for Al-Zan (Authorization). The discussions involved security considerations, optimization strategies, and the potential for new work items within the IETF.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Attestation-Based Client Authentication:**
    *   Discussed an optimization for combining attestation-based client authentication with DPoP (Demonstrating Proof-of-Possession at the Application Layer) by using the same key for both, potentially reducing the number of JOTs in the request.
    *   Addressed concerns about the security implications of key reuse and the optionality of the optimization.
    *   Naming discussion for attestation. Some feel that the term is confusing.
*   **Token Status List:**
    *   Reviewed recent changes to the token status list draft, including validation rules and a status list aggregation mechanism.
    *   Discussed the removal of the unsigned option for status lists and the complexities arising from supporting multiple encoding formats (CBOR, JSON, JOTT, CWT).
*   **FedCM Profile for OAuth:**
    *   Explored the use of FedCM (Federated Credential Management) as a privacy-preserving alternative to third-party cookies for federated identity flows.
    *   Discussed how to integrate OAuth with FedCM by using the assertion endpoint to return an authorization code instead of an ID token.
    *   Addressed the challenge of passing OAuth parameters through the FedCM API and the need for a standardized approach (e.g., namespacing).
*   **Proof of Issuer Key Authority (PICA):**
    *   Presented the PICA draft, which aims to provide a persistent and verifiable record of issuer keys to enable offline validation of JOTs.
    *   Discussed security considerations related to the use of X.509 certificates in PICA and potential mitigations, such as using a prefix for the issuer domain name in the certificate.
    *   Acknowledged the need to address certificate revocation in the draft.
*   **Al-Zan Profile of OAuth:**
    *   Propose an OAuth profile for Al-Zan, a policy decision protocol to standardize authorization requests and responses.
    *   Discussed potential integration points between OAuth and Al-Zan, such as using RAR (Rich Authorization Requests) to convey Al-Zan requests to the authorization server.
    *   Concerns raised that Al-Zan profile could be seen to dictate policy.
*   **Authorization Policy Language (Alpha 2.0):**
    *   Discussed a proposal for Alpha 2.0, a new authorization policy language intended to simplify existing standards and promote reuse across different environments.
    *   Feedback indicated that OAuth would not be the appropriate venue for such a language.
    *   It was noted that this language could work with OAuth tech.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Attestation-Based Client Authentication:** The mailing list to continue the discussion on the trade-offs around DPoP optimization and security considerations.
*   **Token Status List:** Authors will consider feedback regarding unsigned option.
*   **PICA:**
    *   The chairs will make a call for adoption on the mailing list.
    *   The author will address the certificate revocation and security properties for using WebPKI certificates.

## Next Steps

*   Continue discussions on the mailing lists for attestation-based client authentication, token status lists and PICA.
*   Richard to address the negative votes to PICA adoption.
*   Continue development and stabilization of the FedCM spec and exploration of its integration with OAuth.
*   David Hayes to engage with the dispatch group.
