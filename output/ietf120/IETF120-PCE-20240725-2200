## Summary

This IETF meeting focused on the Path Computation Element (PCE) working group. Discussions covered document status, new adoptions, and various proposals, including controlled ID extensions, inter-PCE communication procedures, optical network extensions, and precision availability metrics. Key themes included registry management, experimental ranges for code points, and alignment with other working groups.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Document Status:** Updates were provided on documents past working group last call, nearing last call, and those needing attention. Particular emphasis was placed on progressing the PC multi-path document due to an expiring IANA early code point allocation.
*   **Registry Management:** Discussion centered around transitioning PCE registries back to "IETF Review" status and whether to do this blanket or selectively.
*   **Experimental Range Allocation:** A proposal to allocate experimental code point ranges for PCEP error types (and possibly error values) was discussed.
*   **Controlled ID Extension Draft:** Concerns regarding encoding, message choice (Open, Notification, etc.), and potential reset implications were raised. The discussion led to an exploration of whether the issue should be solved generically using notifications.
*   **Inter-PCE Communication:**  A proposal to use notification messages for inter-PCE state synchronization (specifically for open message information) was discussed.
*   **Optical Network Extensions:**  A presentation was given on extending link state and TE information distribution for optical networks, especially fine-grained OTN. Collaboration with the CCAMP working group was highlighted.
*   **Precision Availability Metrics:** Discussion on applying performance availability metrics for path computation and selection, especially in relation to service-level objectives (SLOs). Issues regarding the feasibility of path computation with these metrics and the need for a new metric object were debated.
*   **P2MP Policy:** Discussion of status of the P2MP policy draft and its dependencies on other working groups. Request for the shepherd to clean up and start early allocation. Andrew Alston to be shepherd.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Registry Management:** Request Julian to consider fast-tracking the blanket registry update.
*   **Controlled ID Extension Draft:** Update the draft with a new revision and share it with the list. Follow the generic notification approach.
*   **Inter-PCE Communication:** Add the notification mechanism into the document and handle Adrian's comments.
*   **P2MP Policy:** Clean up the draft and start the early allocation process.
*   **Optical Network Extensions:** Continue to cover all OTSA technologies, including fine-grained OTN. Call for WG Tablogy adoption. Review by CCAMP to check technology details
*   **Precision Availability Metrics:** Author to provide a pros and cons document for object choice for comment on the list. Look at spring invalidate drafts and related work.

## Next Steps

*   Authors to address comments and concerns raised during the meeting and on the mailing list.
*   Chairs to prioritize documents based on the queue and working group progress.
*   Continued discussions on the mailing list, especially regarding registry management, experimental ranges for code points, and precision availability metrics.
*   Prepare new versions for next IETF.
