## Summary
This session included two presentations. The first presentation was by Stefano on "Moulting Point," a system for evaluating the performance of language transformers on mobile devices. The second presentation was by Anton Fusanko on the Aryan Protocol, a privacy-preserving network layer protocol.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Moulting Point Presentation:**
    *   Discussion on deploying machine learning models on devices, including challenges related to system heterogeneity, simultaneous workloads, download latency, and sustained performance.
    *   Exploration of the trade-offs between model size, accuracy, and deployability on mobile devices.
    *   Analysis of the impact of quantization on model accuracy and performance.
    *   Inquiry about the model performance for LLMs shipped by OS vendors like Apple or Google and first vs third party applications.
    *   Questioning about accuracy of the LLMs versus performance, with specific concern about breaking guardrails and hallucinations.
*   **Aryan Protocol Presentation:**
    *   The protocol aims to provide anonymity for the source and prevent association of consecutive packets to the same flow.
    *   Design choices, including symmetric key cryptography for performance and source routing, are discussed along with their trade-offs.
    *   The use of anonymous key references and routing element shuffling to enhance privacy is explained.
    *   Questions about formal proofs of security and prevention of correlation attacks.
    *   Clarification that the formal aspects relate to formal description of the protocol, not formal verification.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Research Group Last Call:** Chairs intend to perform a research group last call on the discussed draft in the next few weeks. People are encouraged to express strong opposition or opinions very soon.

## Next Steps

*   The presenters will likely continue developing and refining their respective projects based on the feedback received during the session.
*   Further research and development on techniques to prevent correlation attacks are encouraged.
*   Aryan protocol to be adapted into an IETF protocol (IPv6 extension header or new quick version).
