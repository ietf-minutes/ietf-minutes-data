## Summary
This session of the Research and Analysis of Standardization Process Research Group (RASPARG) featured four presentations:
*   Diane Liao (Standards Council of Canada) on gender considerations in standards development.
*   Alessandra Aloka (Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich) on the effects of random selection into NOMCOM on network power and productivity.
*   Kalija Young (Summer Protocols) on applying a regenerative lens to the IETF's protocol development process.
*   Robert Goh (York University) on the non-standard aspects of ActivityPub and the Fediverse.

The discussions covered topics such as gender representation, ethical research considerations, the impact of standardization efforts on individual well-being, and the role of corporate influence in standards development.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Gender Representation in Standards:** The lack of gender balance in standards development organizations (SDOs) was highlighted. Studies suggest that increased female representation in technical committees correlates with better performance.  The need for action plans and integrating gender consideration into SDO accreditation was discussed.
*   **Ethical Considerations in Research:**  Concerns were raised regarding human subject research and privacy when analyzing personal data, even if publicly available.  Anonymization was mentioned as a mitigation.
*   **NOMCOM and Power:**  The nature of power associated with the IETF's Nominating Committee (NOMCOM) was debated. While some viewed it as influential, others emphasized the importance of the regular working group process. Research using NOMCOM's random selection to measure impact on network productivity was presented.
*   **Regenerative Lens for Protocol Development:** Applying regenerative principles (mutualism, agency, diversity) to the IETF's processes was explored, examining how the organization cultivates collective intelligence and manages coherence without formal membership.
*   **ActivityPub and the Fediverse:**  The presentation explored the non-standard aspects of ActivityPub and the Fediverse, including the lack of corporate social media involvement, the standardization of multiple approaches, and the crucial role of Mastodon in pushing the effort.
*   **The Personal Toll of Standards Work:** Discussion emphasized the emotional toll of standards development, including burnout from moderation and admin work. The need for improved financial and emotional support was emphasized.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Share Resources:** Colin Perkins will share the IETF's work on gender issues and the IRTF code of conduct with Diane Liao.
*   **Review Reports:** Colin Perkins will review the reports cited in Diane Liao's slides and pass them on to others within the IETF organization.
*   **Consider UNEC Gender Declaration:** The IETF may consider becoming a signatory of the UNECE gender declaration.
*   **Explore Data:** Alessandra Aloka and her team will explore the productivity of the volunteers instead of just the co-authors to address the disagreements on NOMCOM's power.

## Next Steps

*   Diane Liao will share the website and details of the UNEC and ISO/IEC work on gender-responsive standards.
*   Alessandra Aloka and her team will refine their research, considering feedback on network definitions, potential confounding factors, and ethical research practices.
*   Kalija Young and her colleague will continue their research into applying a regenerative lens to IETF protocol development and seek additional stories from participants.
*   Robert Goh will continue his research on ActivityPub and its implications for ethical social media.
