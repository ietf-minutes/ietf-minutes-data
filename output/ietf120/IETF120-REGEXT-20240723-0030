## Summary

This meeting of the regext working group focused on administrative matters and a discussion about implementation requirements for documents. The main discussion revolved around whether the working group should formalize requirements for implementations before advancing drafts to proposed standard status, drawing comparisons with other IETF working groups like CiderOps and IDR.  A key consideration was balancing the need for implementation experience with the desire to avoid creating unnecessary barriers to participation and innovation. The meeting also touched on the role of the wiki in documenting implementations and process issues around stalemates.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Implementation Requirements:**
    *   A proposal was made to require at least one client and one server implementation before a draft could be advanced to proposed standard status.
    *   Concerns were raised about the small number of implementers in the group, particularly for ARDAP clients.
    *   The potential for new requirements to deter participation and encourage proprietary extensions was discussed.
    *   The differences between client/server implementations vs. two interoperable independent implementations was discussed.
*   **Experimental RFCs:**
    *   The possibility of publishing documents as experimental RFCs when consensus on implementation is lacking was considered.
    *   The benefits of experimental RFCs in retaining IETF change control were noted.
    *   Concerns were raised that designating documents as "experimental" could deter adoption.
*   **Implementation Wiki:**
    *   The potential for using the working group wiki to document implementation status and experience was widely supported.
    *   The ease of updating the wiki by implementers was highlighted as an advantage.
*   **Deleg Relationship:**
    *   The activities of the Deleg working group with potential impact on RegExt were reviewed.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Decision:** No changes will be made to the formal implementation requirements for the working group at this time.  However, targeted implementation requirements may be considered on a case-by-case basis.
*   **Action Item:** The Chairs will work to promote greater use of the working group wiki to document implementation status and experience.
*   **Action Item:** The chair will add to the Regext "toolbox" the opportunity to consider an experimental RFC or external project if stalemate occurs within the working group.
*   **Action Item:** The Chairs will publish a summary of decisions and discussion on the mailing list for review by remote participants.

## Next Steps

*   The working group will continue its discussion of ARDAP considerations on Wednesday.
*   The Chairs will follow up on the action items outlined above.
