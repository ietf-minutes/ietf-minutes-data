## Summary
This meeting covered two documents: Spice Discovery and Identifiers for Businesses. The Spice Discovery document is a call for action to determine if a discovery mechanism is needed within the SPICE working group, particularly in relation to confirmation methods and interoperability with other IETF efforts like WIMS. The Identifiers for Businesses document proposes a URI scheme for globally identifying businesses, aiming to provide context and disambiguation for business identifiers used in attestations and supply chain tracing. Both documents were discussed, with feedback provided and calls for further work and community involvement.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Spice Discovery:**
    *   The document is intended as a placeholder for other discovery work happening within the IETF.
    *   Importance of clarity on expected inputs and outputs for any discovery system.
    *   Consideration of using CBOR instead of JSON for SPICE, given its focus.
    *   Distinction between discovery and trust establishment mechanisms.
    *   Concerns raised regarding the utility of discovery given the time gap between credential issuance and verification.
    *   Privacy implications of discovery systems and potential creation of privacy-violating oracles.
*   **Identifiers for Businesses:**
    *   The purpose is to create a URI scheme (`glue:`) for globally unique business identifiers, associated with an IANA registry to provide context.
    *   The need for this identifier stems from inconsistent use and definition of existing business identifiers.
    *   Privacy concerns related to taxpayer identifiers in specific domains.
    *   Use cases in supply chain tracing and verifiable attestations.
    *   Consideration of the authority responsible for minting these identifiers (e.g., government vs. industry).
    *   Discussion on the relationship to identity providers and the potential for existing systems to provide this number, with claims tied elsewhere.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Spice Discovery:**
    *   The document is not ready for working group adoption.
    *   **Action Item:** Interested individuals should contact Ori or Mike to contribute to the document.
*   **Identifiers for Businesses:**
    *   The document is not ready for working group adoption.
    *   **Action Item:** Interested individuals should contact Brent to contribute to the document.
    *   **Action Item:** Open a GitHub issue to discuss privacy considerations related to taxpayer identifiers and nested organizations.

## Next Steps

*   Continue discussion on the mailing list regarding both documents.
*   Brent will incorporate community feedback and continue developing the Identifiers for Businesses document.
*   Ori seeks interested contributors to help shape the SPICE Discovery document.
*   Coordinate with other working groups, including drone remote identity protocol, to align identifier strategies.
