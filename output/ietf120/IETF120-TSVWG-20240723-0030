## Summary

This TSVWG meeting covered document status updates, discussion of UDP options, and careful resume. The group discussed the need for reviews and contributions to existing drafts. Key decisions included potentially dropping the "user ports for experiments" draft and proceeding with a working group last call for "Convergence of Congestion Control from Retail state" (Careful Resume) before the next IETF meeting.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Document Status:** Review of RFC queue, IESG status, and documents needing revision before publication request (NQB, UDP Options, DPLPMTUD).
*   **Review Importance:** Emphasis on the need for document reviews and feedback, even small suggestions are valuable.
*   **User Ports for Experiments:** Lack of recent updates or discussion. Question of whether to unadopt this work.
*   **UDP Options:** Review of working group last call comments documented in GitHub, covering issues like disambiguating surplus areas, definition of "unsafe," terminology fixes, and clarification on per-fragment options. Discussion about acceptability of passing datagrams when additional payload checksum and authentication fails.
*   **Careful Resume:** Hackathon testing with multiple clients against a server implementation using Cloudflare's Kiche. Successful initial interop test. Discussion on observed variations in client behavior and plans for more rigorous performance testing in Dublin.
*   **Careful Resume Specification Updates:** Draft 08 (CDDL updates, removing unnecessary requirements), Draft 09 (restructuring and cleaning up the document), Draft 10 (BBR support).
*   **Careful Resume Open Issues:** Issue 22 (minimum number of RTT samples) - proposal to close with no action but after discussion it was decided to find a recommendation for a minimum number. Issue 13 (limited sending example) - awaiting feedback on the need for this addition.
*   **Careful Resume Minimum RTT samples:** Discussion on suggested or required number of RTT samples to confirm path characteristics.
*   **Careful Resume Rationale and Requirements:** Add a section stating goals.
*	**Careful Resume Implementation Experience:** Existing implementations in Cloudflare's Kiche and Pico Quake. Testing plans.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **User Ports for Experiments:** Chairs to liaise with the editor and solicit working group feedback to determine whether to unadopt the draft.
*   **UDP Options:** Editor to prepare a new revision addressing the GitHub issues. Chairs will consult with the AD to determine if a new working group last call is needed.
*   **UDP Options:** Zahid was to consider adding editors to this document.
*   **Careful Resume (Issue 22):** Martin to propose a number of RTT samples for issue 22 in the Github
*   **Careful Resume Minimum RTT:** To create a PR with a recommendation for a minimum number of RTT samples to confirm path characteristics.
*   **Careful Resume Rationale and Requirements:** Editors to add a section re-stating requirements and goals.
*   **Careful Resume Working Group Last Call:** Prepare a new version for working group last call before next meeting

## Next Steps

*   Continue discussions on the mailing list, particularly regarding the User Ports for Experiments draft and the remaining issues for Careful Resume.
*   Editors to update drafts based on the meeting discussions.
*   Next meeting to cover NQB, a forest deployment experience update, SCTP, and the new requirements document for network collaboration signaling and L4S interop activities.
