# tsvwg Meeting Minutes

## Summary

The tsvwg meeting covered several active drafts, including NQB, L4S ops, SCTP authentication, DTLS for SCTP, and a new draft on network collaboration signaling. Discussions focused on resolving open issues, clarifying requirements, and determining the direction of future work.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **NQB Draft:**  Discussion centered on traffic protection (mandatory vs. recommended implementation), applicability, and clarification of requirements. Issue 48, regarding traffic protection, was extensively discussed with arguments for and against making it mandatory.
*   **L4S Ops Draft:** Decision on whether to keep the draft open as a living document or close it at the Dublin meeting was discussed.  The lack of recent updates prompted the question.
*   **SCTP Authentication Draft:** Integration of proposals for authenticated chunks and replay protection, along with privacy considerations, were discussed.
*   **DTLS for SCTP Draft:** Updates on the detailed chunk and handshake drafts were presented, along with open issues, particularly whether handshake messages should be encrypted.
*   **Network Collaboration Signaling Draft:** A new draft outlining requirements for host-to-network and server-to-network signaling was presented. Extensive discussion on its scope, existing solutions in other standards bodies (e.g., 3GPP), and its relationship to potential solutions.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **NQB Draft:**
    *   Editor to propose a resolution to Issue 48 (traffic protection) that adheres to the working group consensus, separating out the Wi-Fi case.
    *   Editor to clarify options for managing traffic, rewrite sections, and work with other people to resolve this issue.
    *   Deliver Draft 25 in one or two weeks.
*   **L4S Ops Draft:**
    *   Defer decision on whether to close the draft until the Dublin meeting. Chairs will bring up the topic again.
*   **SCTP Authentication Draft:**
    *   Discussion of proposals 1 and 2 to continue on the mailing list.
    *   Update security considerations with privacy considerations (lack of encryption).
*   **Network Collaboration Signaling Draft:**
    *   Authors to provide an analysis of how the requirements are covered by existing mechanisms in other standards bodies (e.g., 3GPP) and why those may be insufficient.
    *   Authors to consider the operational feedback and revise the document.
    *   Working group to determine the scope of this work and the path forward.

## Next Steps

*   Authors of various drafts to incorporate feedback and address open issues.
*   Continue discussions on the mailing lists.
*   Decision on L4S ops draft at the Dublin meeting.
