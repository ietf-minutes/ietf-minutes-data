# acme

## Summary

This meeting covered the status of several ACME-related drafts, a new proposal for public key challenges, and a discussion on ACME-based attestation using RATS. Key topics included document progress in the RFC editor queue, proposed naming changes, and the exploration of attestation beyond WebAuthn.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **ACME Integrations RFC:** Remains in the RFC editor queue, awaiting dependencies.
*   **ACME DTN node ID:**  Awaiting updates from the DTN working group. A short working group last call will be initiated after a minor naming update is made.
*   **Estonion:** Publication requested and is with Deb.
*   **Acme IRA:** Publication requested with some clarifications being discussed.
*   **Public Key Challenge:** A new draft proposing a new ACME challenge type to track public key information throughout the ACME process to prevent public key replacement attacks.
*   **ACME RATS:** Discussion of a more generic attestation mechanism for ACME, extending beyond WebAuthn to cover a wider range of attestation scenarios, particularly related to device management and security posture. Use cases discussed involved obtaining S-MIME certificates based on corporate MDM enrollment. Differentiated authorization (proving ownership) from attestation (proving platform characteristics).

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **ACME DTN node ID:** The chairs will initiate a short working group last call for the draft after the author updates it with the agreed-upon naming change.
*   **Public Key Challenge:** The authors will send a message to the mailing list reminding people to read the draft and provide feedback.
*   **ACME RATS:** The authors (Michael Hutchinson, Peter Campbell, and Thomas Fossati) will work on a draft for a generic attestation mechanism based on RATS.

## Next Steps

*   Authors to update and resubmit drafts as needed.
*   Working group last call to be initiated for ACME DTN node ID.
*   Authors to collaborate on an initial draft for ACME RATS.
*   Participants to review the "Public Key Challenge" draft and provide feedback on the mailing list.
