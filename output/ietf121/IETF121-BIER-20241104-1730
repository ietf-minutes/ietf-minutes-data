## Summary

This BIER working group session covered the status of various BIER-related drafts, discussed the PIM and MLDP signaling over BIER drafts by Huma, and introduced a new draft on scaling BRTE using unicast TE tunnels by Troels.  Several action items were identified regarding draft updates, shepherding, and reviews.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Draft Status:** Several drafts are awaiting AD review, shepherd review, or need refreshing.  The OSPFV3 draft has outstanding comments from AD Hang since April. The Non-MPLS extensions have expired.
*   **BIER EVPN:**  The BIER EVPN draft has been published.
*   **BIER Tether:**  BIER tether is under AD review, with active discussions on the IGP side.
*   **Early Directorate Reviews:** There was discussion on whether to solicit early directorate reviews for certain drafts before pushing them to the AD.  The general consensus was to try to get early review to ease the load on the AD.
*   **PIM Signaling over BIER (Huma):** This draft is being updated to incorporate PIM Light.  A discussion ensued regarding whether or not to signal the BFR ID in the PIM Join messages, especially when an IGP is present. The question was raised about the need to duplicate information that is available in the IGP. It was agreed this needed to be discussed offline.
*   **MLDP Signaling over BIER (Huma):**  This draft had a last call that has expired. Huma is reviving this and pushing it through the process.
*   **Scaling BRTE (Troels):** A new draft was presented on scaling BRTE using unicast TE tunnels from a BFIR to an egress domain. The approach aims to formalize existing architectural guidance and address FRR considerations. The concept involves partitioning the network into sub-topologies, each served by a single bit string.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Non-MPLS Extensions:** Refresh the non-MPLS extensions draft.
*   **LSR/IDR Extensions:** The chairs will poke Jeff and Guy from the IDR working group for feedback on the BGP/LS extensions.
*   **BIER BFD:** Donald is the shepherd. Confirm and proceed.
*   **BIER Ping:**  The chair will look into the outstanding routing directorate comments and address them.
*   **Path MTU Discovery:** Needs a shepherd review.
*   **BROM Requirements:** Needs a shepherd review.
*   **BIER in IPv6:** Send to 6man and get early directorate review (InterArea Sec).
*   **Prefix Redistribution:** Needs a shepherd.
*   **MLDP Signaling over BIER:** Greg Murray Erickson volunteered to be the shepherd.
*   **OAM Requirements:** Verify with Huma that he is happy to be a shepherd on OAM requirements for BIER.

## Next Steps

*   Authors to address action items and update drafts accordingly.
*   Continue discussions on the mailing list, particularly regarding the PIM signaling over BIER draft.
*   Huma and others will have off-line discussion of when and if PIM signaling needs the additional BFRID
