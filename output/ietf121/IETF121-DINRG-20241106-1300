## Summary
The DINRG session focused on decentralization of the internet. Presentations covered distributed DDoS analytics, the role of DNS names in internet decentralization, and the effects of internet consolidation. The session included discussions on future directions for the group, including measuring centralization, improving terminology, and exploring naming/identification solutions.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Distributed DDoS Analytics:**
    *   Presentation on distributing DDoS analytics among ASes to mitigate reflection amplification attacks.
    *   Discussed the challenges of local detection and the benefits of collaboration between networks.
    *   Proposed a governance layer and a distributed information exchange point (DXP) for sharing attack information.
    *   Addressed questions about reflectors being attacked themselves and fixing the issue at the source.
*   **DNS Names and Internet Decentralization:**
    *   Presentation on assigning DNS names to users to enable direct user-to-user communication and decentralize control over identity and data.
    *   Discussed the use of DNS names as identifiers and the potential for building user-controlled applications.
    *   Addressed concerns about the centralized control of DNS and the role of the presenter as a "cloud provider."
    *   Addressed questions about use cases for DNS vs other decentralization technologies.
*   **Effects of Internet Consolidation:**
    *   Update on two drafts: "On the Effect of Internet Consolidation" and a taxonomy draft.
    *   Argued that protocol design, not just economics, leads to centralization.
    *   Introduced the idea that centralization leads to imbalances of power.
    *   Discussed metrics and measurement for centralization.
    *   Addressed comments and incorporated revisions, including definitions of centralization, consolidation, and related terms.
*   **Future Work Discussion:**
    *   Discussed the meaning of "decentralized" and the distinction between technical centralization and centralization of control.
    *   Explored the potential for commoditizing platform components to support decentralized system designs.
    *   Debated the feasibility and role of DINRG in promoting decentralization and connecting the community.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Action Item:** Follow up on the mailing list regarding the adoption of the consolidation and taxonomy drafts.
*   **Action Item:** Invite economists, regulators, and other experts to participate in DINRG discussions.
*   **Decision:** Continue to measure and document the level of centralization and its effects.
*   **Decision:** Analyze system issues vs control issues and look at root causes.
*   **Decision:** Promote and encourage discussion on naming and identification solutions for decentralization.

## Next Steps

*   Continue discussions on the mailing list.
*   Encourage participation in the upcoming ACM Konex conference workshop.
*   Explore potential collaborations with other IRTF groups and the IETF community.
*   Consider a multidisciplinary approach to addressing issues of centralization.
