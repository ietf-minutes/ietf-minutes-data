# dnsop

## Summary
The DNSOP working group held its second session, focusing on the following presentations:
*   Integration of DNSW domain names into application environments
*   Extended DNS error codes
*   Dot internal private use
*   Upper limit values for DNS

The meeting included discussions on potential adoption of drafts, the applicability of certain DNS concepts, and the need for further exploration of certain aspects.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Integration of DNSW domain names:** The discussion focused on the motivations and challenges of integrating DNS domain names into application environments, particularly new use cases such as blockchain and AI. Concerns were raised about lifecycle management and the potential for inadvertent name collisions. There was support for the WG to consider adopting the draft.
*   **Extended DNS error codes:** The debate centered around whether to add specific or general error codes and the need for guidance on using new error codes.  Warren Kumari noted the ongoing discussion within the IESG regarding internet drafts being referenced in registries. There were concerns about whether an error code for local routes had merit.
*   **Dot internal private use:**  Discussion included whether `.internal` should be treated as a special use domain name akin to RFC 1918 addresses and whether a formal delegation should occur. Opinions differed on the IETF's involvement in this matter.  The document authors indicated that the document was initally intended as an informational RFC.
*   **Upper limit values for DNS:** The presentation proposed setting upper limits on DNS parameters to mitigate resource depletion and DoS attacks. Discussion focused on the practical challenges of setting and maintaining these limits, the risk of ossification, and the impact on diverse network deployments.
## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Integration of DNSW domain names:** The chairs will schedule a working group call for adoption after IETF 121.
*   **Dot internal private use:** Action item to consider whether to adopt the document as a working group item, considering the benefits of working group consensus.
*   **Upper limit values for DNS:** Action item to continue discussion on the mailing list and to explore documenting existing implicit limits.

## Next Steps

*   Continue discussion on the mailing lists for all presented drafts.
*   Schedule a working group call for adoption of the `Integration of DNSW domain names` draft.
*   Further analyze and refine the content and status of the `Dot internal private use` draft based on working group feedback.
*   Further explore the concept of upper limits and consult with DNS implementers, including documentation on existing undocumented limits for `Upper limit values for DNS`.
