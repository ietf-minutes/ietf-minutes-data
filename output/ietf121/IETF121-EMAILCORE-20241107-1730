# emailcore

## Summary

This emailcore session focused on reviewing open tickets related to the SMTP base document. Discussions included clarifying language, addressing security considerations, and improving overall document clarity. Key topics involved CNAME handling, normative references to security, and the use of the TURN extension. Decisions were made on several tickets, and action items were assigned to improve the document.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Destination Mailbox Case:** Discussion on whether the destination mailbox needs to be in uppercase. John Klensin will propose alternative text for clarification if necessary.
*   **I-D Status:** The Area Director will ensure the document is updated appropriately after IESG review.
*   **CNAME Chains:** Discussion on the use of CNAME chains and proposed textual changes to accommodate the reality of their usage.
*   **RR Records:** Confirmation that the proposed change to text listing RR records is factually correct.
*   **Security Considerations:** Extensive discussion on where and how to address security considerations, specifically TLS and related extensions. Consensus leaned towards informative references to the AS document and potentially adding text to the introduction.
*   **TURN Extension:** Discussion on the use of the TURN extension and whether the "should not" usage is appropriate. The decision was made to leave it as is, with the AD ready to defend the decision during IESG review.
*   **Authentication Section Title:** A proposal was made to modify the authentication section title.
*   **Hello/EHLO Ambiguity:** Discussion around the ambiguity of Hello/EHLO commands. Art and Pete volunteered to analyze the document text and identify areas for clarification.
*   **Response Codes:** Question whether the group headings are correct and volunteer to check from group.
