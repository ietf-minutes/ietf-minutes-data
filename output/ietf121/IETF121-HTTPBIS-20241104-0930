## Summary

This IETF 121 meeting covered several active drafts and new topics, including resumable uploads, query methods, cache groups, incremental HTTP messages, wrap-up capsules, capsule protocol extensions, and cookie deletion. The group discussed technical details, potential interoperability issues, and future directions for these areas. Several proposals gained support, and action items were identified for document updates and further exploration.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Resumable Uploads:** The draft is nearing completion after recent updates and hackathon interoperability testing. Concerns were raised regarding client handling of intermediate responses (1XX status codes), and the potential need for an implementation note regarding interoperability, as well as the exposure of these codes to application developers. The use of OPTIONS for upload limit detection was also discussed.
*   **Query Method:** The meeting addressed open issues related to conditional query semantics, the `Accept-Query` header (including the choice between structured fields and the existing `Accept` header syntax), media type semantics, cache key normalization, and the use of direct vs. indirect responses.
*   **Cache Groups:** The draft is nearing completion after feedback from the last call was addressed. The chairs encouraged more participation from cache vendors in reviewing the specification.
*   **Incremental HTTP Message:** This new proposal aims to address the inconsistency in incremental delivery of HTTP messages due to buffering intermediaries. The discussion included alternative error signaling mechanisms (warn vs. fail), client behavior on receiving errors, and applicability to both requests and responses.
*   **Wrap-up Capsule:** This proposal for a mechanism to signal graceful flow termination gained support. The potential for client-initiated wrap-up and the inclusion of a retry bit in the capsule were discussed.
*   **Capsule Protocol Extensions:** This proposal aimed at fixing and improving how Capsule Protocols operate with different capsule types, the need for better error codes, and negotiation of new types was considered to need improvements. A debate on if unknown type endpoints included proxies ended with guidance and lessons learned to make sure implementations treat the packets as expected.
*   **Cookie Deletion:** A proposal to add a `Delete-Cookie` header was presented, allowing servers to delete cookies without knowing the domain and path. Discussions included deleting multiple cookies with the same name, addressing cookie confusion attacks, and whether this change should be incorporated into the next cookie revision draft.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Resumable Uploads:** Authors to perform an editorial pass of the draft and incorporate an implementation note regarding handling of intermediate responses. Add a test case for multiple 1XX responses to the demo server.
*   **Query Method:** Authors to proceed with the proposed solutions for open issues, leveraging structured fields for the `Accept-Query` header, and aiming for a working group last call after updates.
*   **Cache Groups:** A participant will provide a positive statement about the draft to the mailing list to support the last call process.
*   **Wrap-up Capsule:** Working group chairs to schedule an adoption call for this draft.
*   **Capsule Protocol Extensions:** Review and address proposed improvements/guidance for capsule treatment for adoption consideration.
*   **Cookie Deletion:** Authors to prepare an Internet Draft for the `Delete-Cookie` header, which will then be considered for incorporation into the next cookie revision draft. The proposed mechanisms should then be discussed and added to the BIS document.

## Next Steps

*   Authors will update drafts based on the discussions.
*   The working group will conduct adoption calls for the wrap-up capsule and capsule protocol extensions proposals.
*   The working group will continue discussions on the mailing list.
*   The next meeting will be held on Thursday to discuss additional topics.
