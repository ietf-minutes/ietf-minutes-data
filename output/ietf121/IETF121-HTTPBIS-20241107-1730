# httpbis

## Summary

The HTTPbis working group meeting covered several topics, including a discussion on a draft proposing a YANG grouping for HTTP client/server configuration, the Connect TCP draft, Security Considerations for Optimistic Protocol Transitions, No Vary Search, and a new proposal for geolocation using HTTP client hints.  The main discussion centered on the use of HTTP client hints for geolocation and the trade-offs between user privacy and providing relevant location information to servers.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **YANG Grouping for HTTP Client/Server Configuration:** Concerns were raised about the draft's configuration options for explicitly selecting HTTP versions, potentially circumventing protocol negotiation mechanisms and hindering future HTTP evolution.  Consensus leaned towards removing this configuration knob.
*   **Connect TCP:**  Discussion focused on whether to mandate both "Connect TCP" and "Connect TCP Capsule" upgrade tokens, or only one. The potential for user confusion with URI templates and upgrade tokens was debated, alongside the use of capsules.  The group seemed to lean toward consolidating on a single protocol, capsule-only.
*   **Security Considerations for Optimistic Protocol Transitions:** This draft included new text related to HTTP Connect. An issue regarding proxy-initiated connection closures and their negative impact on performance and correct implementation was raised. Consideration of HTTP version applicability was discussed.
*   **No Vary Search:**  The draft, which replaces a requirement in RFC911, allows a cache to examine stored responses to determine reusability for a request. Discussion included how to efficiently implement it and concerns about the name "search".
*   **IP Geolocation:**  The main discussion revolved around a proposal to use HTTP client hints to send a coarse geolocation to servers while masking the client's IP address.  Concerns were raised regarding the potential for misuse, the interaction with VPNs, and the overall privacy implications. There was discussion of leveraging existing knowledge from the IETF's geo-privacy work.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **YANG Grouping for HTTP Client/Server Configuration:** Authors should further discuss the community feedback and consider removing the HTTP version selection configuration options.
*   **Connect TCP:** Ben to consolidate on a single protocol, capsule-only.
*   **Security Considerations for Optimistic Protocol Transitions:** Ben to add text to address HTTP version limitations of the normative text. Eric to provide more details about issues experienced with proxy connection closures.
*   **IP Geolocation:**  The working group will not adopt the current document, but instead will further explore the requirements for geolocation in a privacy-preserving fashion.

## Next Steps

*   Authors of the YANG grouping draft to consider feedback and potential revisions.
*   Ben to update the Connect TCP draft and consolidate.
*   Ben to update the Security Considerations draft to address the HTTP version and proxy connection closure concerns.
*   Jeremy to continue working on No Vary Search.
*   Continue discussing the requirements for IP Geolocation on the mailing list.
