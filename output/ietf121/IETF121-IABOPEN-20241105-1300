# iabopen

## Summary

The IAB Open meeting covered several key topics, including updates on IAB documents and programs, liaison updates, workshops (both upcoming and past), and a discussion on the Global Digital Compact (GDC).  The meeting focused on fostering community engagement and seeking feedback on ongoing initiatives, particularly regarding liaison relationships and new work adoption within the IETF.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **IAB Document Updates:** Discussion of existing documents, including RFC 9614 (partitioning as an architecture for privacy) and the bias workshop report, and an update noting the publication of the AI Control workshop report.
*   **IAB Role in Shepherding New Work:** The IAB's role in supporting BOFs, providing architectural guidance, and offering a new work help desk.  Feedback solicited from the community on additional support mechanisms.
*   **Liaison Statement Updates (RFC 4053/4050):**  The age of existing RFCs, unclear guidance, lack of clarity on the value of liaison statements, and the need for updated tooling were cited as reasons for revision.  The IAB plans to create a GitHub repository and solicit community feedback early in the process. Concerns were raised about adapting to other SDO processes instead of expecting them to fit the IETF's processes.
*   **ITUT Liaison Update:** Scott Mansfield provided an overview of ITU-T's structure, elected officials, and key study groups relevant to the IETF.  He emphasized the importance of technology diplomats and coordinating efforts to avoid duplicate work and conflict.
*   **NEMOPs Workshop (Upcoming):** Suresh provided an update on the NEMOPs workshop, focusing on reviewing past recommendations, exploring future network management techniques, and identifying potential steps for the IETF and IRTF.
*   **AI Control Workshop (Past):** Mark Nottingham and Suresh outlined the outcomes of the recent AI control workshop.  The discussion centered on defining success criteria for AI control, expressing content owner preferences, and potential standardization of communication around these preferences.
*   **Global Digital Compact (GDC):** Olaf Kolkman provided context on the GDC, its development process, and ISOC's considerations regarding endorsement. Concerns around the consultation driven process and the governance of the digital space were highlighted.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Liaison Statement RFC Updates:** Create GitHub repository and solicit community feedback on updates to RFC 4053/4050. The IAB members Miria and Suresh are responsible for pushing forward the RFC updates.
*   **NEMOPs Workshop:** ITUT representative to be invited to submit a position paper for NEMOPs workshop, focusing on Yang at scale.
*   **AI Control Workshop:** Write and send liaison to ITUT and other Standards Development Organizations with information about the AI Control workshop and current focus on content owner preferences and narrow problem of communication of preferences.
*   **Global Digital Compact (GDC):** ISOC and IAB to determine whether to endorse the vision and principles of the GDC, considering concerns about the process and potential consequences.
* **New Work Help Desk:** IAB will offer a new work help desk again at this IETF.

## Next Steps

*   Publish a zero-zero draft of the updated Liaison Statement RFCs for community feedback.
*   Continue collecting community input on liaison relationship management.
*   IAB to write a blog post for the ITUT and other Standards Development Organizations to highlight and discuss with them the AI Control Workshop.
*   IAB to consider if the community needs to engage further with the GDC.
