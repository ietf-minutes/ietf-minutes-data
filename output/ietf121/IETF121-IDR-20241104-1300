# IDR Meeting - IETF 121 Dublin

## Summary

The IDR meeting at IETF 121 covered a variety of topics related to BGP extensions and routing security. Presentations included updates on existing drafts, new proposals for flow specification and SRv6, and discussions on routing security and origin validation. Key themes included addressing inter-domain routing challenges, improving network security, and leveraging BGP for traffic engineering. Several documents were nearing working group last call, and discussions were held regarding the appropriate venue for specific areas of work.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **BGPLS SR Policy (Ketan):** Clarifications and updates based on implementations and feedback from the working group and Shepherd Review. Ready for working group last call.
*   **BGPLS for Multi-Topology Segment Routing (Chongfong):** Applicability of BGPLS with MT for Segment Routing in base network resource partitions. No new BGP extensions were introduced. Updated terminology and descriptions.  Document is likely going to Working Group Last Call.
*   **VPN Prefix ORF (Wei Wang):** Updates including modified descriptions and format of SPEC. Source PE identifier was newly defined.  Working group review is desired.
*   **Flow Spec for SRv6 (Robin):** Introduction of new BGP flow specification for SRv6 filtering. This is a split out from the more IP filters draft and is going back to its original function to help implement choices.
*   **Flow Spec Indirection ID for SRv6 (Robin):** Proposal for a new subtype value for SRv6 in the FlowSpec redirect to indirection ID extended community. Soliciting comments and refinement of the draft.
*   **Packet Content Filter for BGP Flow Spec (Yu-Jean):** Proposal for a new type of flow spec filter to defend against DDoS attacks.  Seeking comments on new offset types. Component ordering is an important aspect of this draft.
*   **SRv6 Policy List Optimizations (Safa G):** Optimization by removing endpoint node SID. Discussion on whether the exclusion flag attribute should be policy or candidate path level attribute. The intent is to work with a co-author from another draft to merge documents.
*   **FCBGP Protocol (Zhuo Tau):** Secure routing protocol for partial deployment. Update on the protocol. Major change is regarding a comparison with BGPSEC.
*   **BGPLS Flexible Algorithm (Arvin):** BGPL support for Flexalgo extensions in IGP. Proposes new extensions defined in Flexalgo enhancements in IGP area.
*   **BGP for RPKI as Yang Model (Jishnu):** Yang models for origin validation, BGPSEC path, and BGP ASPA. Focus on tracking validation states and providing statistical data.
*   **Route Origin Registry Issues (Senglin):** Discussion of challenges in route origin registries and the need for improved data quality and coverage. It was discussed that this topic might be better suited for GROW or CIDER-OPS.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **BGPLS SR Policy:** Proceed to working group last call after closing the review with Sue.
*   **BGPLS for Multi-Topology Segment Routing:** Proceed to working group last call shortly, if no further comments arise.
*   **VPN Prefix ORF:** Request working group review and address the concerns on the due formats (Kair and Sue).
*   **Flow Spec for SRv6:** Coordinate with the BGP Flow Spec version 2 working group.
*   **Flow Spec Indirection ID for SRv6:** Refine draft based on comments.
*   **FCBGP Protocol:**
    *   Request an ASPath code point from IANA.
    *   Consider John's comments, especially regarding performance and packing.
    *   Review the archives to reference to the design considerations document that wen lin BGPSC had.
*   **BGPLS Flexible Algorithm:** Send in the adoption request.

## Next Steps

*   Authors to address comments and feedback received during the meeting and on the mailing list.
*   Working group chairs to schedule confirming/adoption calls for relevant drafts.
*   Continue discussions on the mailing list for unresolved issues and open questions.
*   Evaluate potential rechartering of the IDR working group to reflect current activities.
