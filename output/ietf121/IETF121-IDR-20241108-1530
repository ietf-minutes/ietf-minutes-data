## Summary

The IDR session at IETF 121 covered a variety of topics, including updates on the 5G metadata draft, tunnel eager draft, flow spec V2, BGP security, and other routing protocol extensions. Discussions focused on implementation status, interoperability, specification clarity, and potential impacts on BGP scalability. Several requests for working group adoption were made.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **5G Metadata Draft:** Discussion revolved around the scope of the "limited domain" concept, integration of metadata metrics into the BGP decision process, and implementation status. It was suggested to simplify BGP signaling by using a composite value calculated at the egress.
*   **Tunnel Eager Draft:**  The presentation covered extending BGP to carry additional information to support full schedule for AI networks. Interoperability concerns were raised, specifically the need for at least two interworking implementations to progress the draft. Concerns were raised regarding a lack of certain chipset capabilities.
*   **SR Policy Admin Flag:** Presentation of updates to the SR Policy Admin Flag draft, including flags for disabling, ignoring service looters prefix, and marking drop-upon-invalid behavior.
*   **Flow Spec V2:** A comprehensive overview of the goals and design principles behind FlowSpec V2 was provided, focusing on user ordering, action chaining, and handling of failed actions. There was a call for early feedback from implementers and discussion around whether to create registries for managing drafts.
*   **BGP Scheduling:** A flow spec extension for traffic scheduling, specifically for handling peak traffic times.
*   **BGP Performance Metrics:** A new PTPLS extension to carry the IGPT metric and bandwidth, link delay, and link loss information in the EPPETPM.
*   **Inter-Domain Forwarding Consistency:** A discussion about inconsistencies between the BGP AS path and the actual forwarding path, raising concerns about traffic holes, loops, and potential security risks.  Concerns were raised that a thorough fix would make BGP unscalable.
*   **BGP Route Capability:** Presentation of a new BGP capability for indicating supported route types, to prevent issues with implementations that cannot parse specific updates.
*   **IPv4 Islands over IPv6 Core:** Updates to a draft aimed at connecting IPv4 islands over an IPv6 core, similar to 6PE. A call for workgroup adoption was issued.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **5G Metadata Draft:**
    *   Add a section about implementation status and call for implementation reports.
    *   Consider signaling a composite value of metadata instead of raw TLVs.
*   **Flow Spec V2:**
    *   Solicit early feedback from implementers.
    *   Consider early allocation for SAFIs, capability codes, and action ordering.
    *   The IDR chairs will start an adoption call for "more IP filters."
*   **IPv4 Islands over IPv6 Core:** The IDR chairs will set up a GitHub repository and encourage English language edits.

## Next Steps

*   **5G Metadata Draft:** Update the draft based on the feedback received.
*   **Flow Spec V2:** Continue discussions and solicit feedback on the mailing list. Initiate adoption call for the "more IP filters" document.
*   **Tunnel Eager Draft:** Discuss possible interworking implementation possibilities on the mailing list.
*   **Inter-Domain Forwarding Consistency:** Discuss the draft further on the mailing list.
*   **IPv4 Islands over IPv6 Core:**  Continue development with a focus on editing for improved English. Proceed with adoption on the mailing list.
