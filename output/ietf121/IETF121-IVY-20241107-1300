## Summary

The IETF 121 ivy working group meeting covered several key drafts related to network inventory modeling. Presentations included updates on the core model, software extensions, license/entitlement management, and passive network inventory. A significant portion of the meeting was dedicated to discussing open issues and soliciting feedback on the various drafts.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Network Inventory Core Model:**  Discussion focused on prioritizing remaining issues, categorizing them into priority levels for resolution before or after working group last call, or for future consideration in separate models. The scope and terminology of network elements and components were discussed, including handling virtual network elements and software components.
*   **Port Modeling:**  The group discussed various approaches for port modeling (RFC8348-like, open-config-like, Tapit-Lite).  The process for updating the IANA hardware YANG model was questioned, and it was determined that the group should pick an approach and move forward.
*   **Energy Object:**  The inclusion of an energy object in the base model was discussed, considering existing definitions in RFC-8340 and coordination with the "green" working group. A conclusion was that the authors of 8340 should be consulted to clarify the definition before proceeding.
*   **Stack and Chassis Modeling:** A proposal for modeling stack switches and multi-shelf switches was presented, with emphasis on including all elements under control for completeness.
*   **Network Inventory Software Extension:** An update on the software extension model was presented, covering non-physical network elements and software components. The document is considered ready for working group adoption.
*   **License/Entitlement Management:** The complexities of modeling entitlements and licenses were discussed. The scope of "features" and usage restrictions was debated, and the group explored options to define features as string lists or link the feature to Yang packages, or possibly tie to other components. The importance of addressing the specific use cases of operators was highlighted.
*   **Passive Network Inventory:** A zero-zero draft for passive network inventory was presented, including modeling of passive devices and fiber cables. Discussions covered topological aspects, cable segments, and integration of measured versus estimated values.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Network Inventory Core Model:** The authors will send the list of prioritized issues to the mailing list for working group feedback and agreement.
*   **Port Modeling:** The authors will select the open-config-like modeling approach for ports and incorporate it into the draft.  Mahesh will assist with information on the IANA Yang module update process.
*   **Energy Object:** The authors will contact the authors of RFC 8340 for clarification of the existing "energy" identity before defining a component as a generalization of other entities in the definition.
*   **Network Inventory Software Extension:** The working group will move forward with adopting the network inventory software extension document.
*   **License/Entitlement Management:** The discussion regarding modeling features and capabilities will continue on the mailing list to further clarify operator use cases and requirements.
*   **Passive Network Inventory:** There will be further community discussion on the passive inventory draft and consideration of potential co-authors.

## Next Steps

*   Authors to update drafts based on meeting feedback.
*   Discussions to continue on the mailing list, especially regarding prioritization of issues in the core model and the scope of "features" in the license/entitlement model.
*   The working group will schedule an interim meeting if necessary to address specific topics or issues.
