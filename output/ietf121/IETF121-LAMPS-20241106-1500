## Summary
This LAMPS working group meeting covered composite signatures, message level crypto mechanisms (ML-CHEM), CMS updates, and a security vulnerability in CMS related to signed attributes. The discussion included considerations for FIPS compliance, API design, and key management. A key takeaway was the decision to move forward with seeds for key representation. An interim meeting was scheduled to address remaining agenda items.

## Key Discussion Points
*   **Composite Signatures:**  Discussions revolved around the inclusion of context in the signature API, balancing alignment with FIPS 204 and improving future security. The length and composition of domain separators were also debated to prevent signature stripping attacks.
*   **ML-CHEM:** Addressed alignment with NIST and other working groups (X-Wing). Focus on KDF choices and potential FIPS compliance issues with HKDF. The group debated whether to offer every option with both SHA2 and SHA3, or to make an opinionated choice depending on the security level. A discussion of CNSA 2.0 and the possibility of needing something stronger despite the shared secret being 32 bytes came up.
*   **Key Management:** Decided to use seeds (option 2) as the standard private key format.
*   **CMC:** A review of updates including direct pop.
*   **CMS:** Discussion of draft revisions for MLDSA and ML-CHEM in CMS, including digest algorithms and KDF options.
*   **Security Vulnerability in CMS:** A presentation and discussion of an existential unforgeability (EUF) attack in CMS related to the optional use of signed attributes.  A potential solution involves adding a "signing context" attribute to the CMS structure.

## Decisions and Action Items
*   **Composite Signatures:**
    *   Falco to create a GitHub issue to discuss prepending a longer constant string to the M' prime for domain separation.
    *   The group agreed the authors should rewrite the slide on the "pre-hash" API to reflect current thinking.
*   **ML-CHEM:**
    *   John Mattsson to post to the mailing list to solicit feedback on KDF choices and FIPS compliance.
    *   Authors to include ED448 after clarification from Erickson.
    *   Authors to amend their amendment to re-include ED448
*   **Key Management:** The group agreed to use seeds (option 2) for representing private keys.
*   **CMC:** Implementer to include content encryption algorithm.

## Next Steps
*   Schedule an interim meeting to address remaining agenda items, including EUF CMA attack presentation.
*   John Gray and Sean to discuss and collaborate on CMP updates.
