## Summary

This session of the MOQ working group focused on several key areas: an interop report, updates to the MOQT draft, a new proposal for joining live streams ("join"), and a discussion around resolving ambiguities in priority handling. The session involved presentations and open discussion, with a decision made to move forward with a PR for the "join" proposal. The priority discussion was deferred to the next session with assigned reading material.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Interop Report:**
    *   Successful interop testing with multiple QUIC implementations.
    *   Need to add more comprehensive test cases, including relay scenarios.
    *   Discussion about creating a media interop spreadsheet and the need to agree on a working group draft for media layers on top of QUIC (e.g., Warp and Lock).
*   **MOQT Draft Updates:**
    *   Changes since the last IETF meeting, including the addition of subscribe announces, subgroups, and fetch, as well as the removal of missing groups status and track per stream.
    *   Clarification of fin and reset semantics in the context of subgroups.
*   **Join Proposal (Will et al.):**
    *   Proposal to address the inefficient way to join a live stream in the current MOQT specification, involving two RTTs (subscribe and fetch).
    *   The proposed solution automates the stitching between fetch and subscribe on the server side.
    *   Two implementation ideas were debated: 1. new API call for `join` 2. use existing API calls and add a field to `fetch`. 
    *   Concerns raised about potential flattening of priorities with fetch and its impact on layered media encoding (e.g., SVC). The group also discussed the delivery model.
*   **Priority Ambiguities (Alan & Victor):**
    *   Discussion about resolving ambiguities in the draft regarding priority handling of objects and subgroups.
    *   Proposal 1: Publisher-set track priority based on an explicit setting.
    *   Proposal 2: Remove the concept of track priority and base everything on subgroup priority which is a combination of what the subscriber sent for the track priority and what the publisher set for the subgroup priority.
    *   Discussion around retroactivity of the signal when the priority of a track changes.
    *   Concerns raised about delivery timeouts. Also, complexity of implementation.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Join Proposal:** The working group agreed to move forward with proposal 2. Will will create a PR for extending `fetch` to include a reference to an existing subscription.
*   **Priority Ambiguities:** Decision to defer the discussion and decision to the next session.
    *   **Action Item:** Attendees to read Alan's write-up and Victor's PR on the priority handling proposals before the next session.

## Next Steps

*   Will creates a PR for extending `fetch`
*   Continue the discussion and make a decision regarding priority handling in the next session.
*   Discuss and possibly adopt a document on media layers on top of QUIC (Warp and Lock) on the mailing list.
*   Next step will be a short decision phase at the next Wednesday session.
