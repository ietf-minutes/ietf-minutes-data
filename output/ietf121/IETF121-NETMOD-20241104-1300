# netmod

## Summary

The netmod working group met to discuss several topics, including system-defined configuration, sub-interface drafts, guidelines for YANG module RFCs, YANG module versioning, and YANG packages. The group also discussed issues related to reusability in YANG, updating YANG modules with errata, and future directions for YANG development (YANG Next).

## Key Discussion Points

*   **System-Defined Configuration:** A new revision of the system-defined configuration draft removes copy-related sections. A second working group last call will be initiated.
*   **Sub-interface and Interface Extension YANG:** Updates to the sub-interface and interface extension YANG drafts were presented. The interface extension draft will be updated with additional statistics. The working group plans to push these documents to publication.
*   **Guidelines for YANG Module RFCs:** Discussion around long trees in YANG modules and clarification of templates for revised models. Concerns were raised about the security templates. A proposal to be explicit about the absence of certain elements in documents (e.g., RPCs, readable data nodes) was debated.
*   **YANG Module Versioning and File Naming:** Discussion around file naming conventions, extension statements for non-backwards compatible changes, and the necessity of modifiers in YANG Semver.
*   **YANG Packages:** Update on the revived YANG packages work. The discussion focused on keeping the design simple and issues related to deviation handling and schema mounts.
*   **Immutable Flag:** Discussion on whether to formally update existing Netconf and Restconf specifications. The group agreed that the document should update the base protocol documents.
*   **Common YANG Data Model for Scheduling:** The document is considered stable and a working group last call will be requested, including specific directorates.
*   **YANG Next:** A scoring team analyzed open issues. The conclusion was a need to publish a 2.0, with discussion on how to proceed. It was suggested to summarize the groups of features for YANG Next and get consensus before implementation.
*   **Yang++:** A project focused on reusability in Yang was presented.
*   **YANG Module Errata:** A problem was raised about bugs in YANG modules in published RFCs and slow update processes. A proposal was made to update models using errata and publish them in an official registry.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **System-Defined Configuration:** Initiate a second working group last call.
*   **Sub-interface and Interface Extension YANG:** Authors to incorporate final comments and prepare for publication.
*   **Guidelines for YANG Module RFCs:** Authors to consider the suggestion from the AD about security templates. Workgroup will discuss the updated text and approach on the mailing list.
*   **Immutable Flag:** Proceed with updating the relevant RFCs. Robert Wilton to finalise list response and send to list before sending to liaisons.
*   **YANG Packages:** Re-announce weekly call details on the mailing list.
*   **YANG Next:**  Write a draft document capturing the categories of issues being worked on to enable working group adoption of the scope for Yang Next efforts.
*   **YANG Module Errata:** Belage to write up a document describing the proposal to update models using errata and publish them in an official registry.

## Next Steps

*   Follow-up discussions on the mailing list for open issues.
*   Authors to update drafts based on the meeting discussions and prepare for last calls or publication.
*   Continue weekly YANG Packages discussion.
*   Address the liaison statement related to the immutable flag.
*   Proceed with the process described above under Decisions and Action Items.
