## Summary

The NETMOD working group session focused on the topic of configuration templates in YANG.  The session included an introduction to the need for standardization, presentations of four different templating ideas, and a discussion regarding the importance of standardization and comparison of the proposed solutions. The main goal was to determine if the working group should pursue standardization of a template mechanism. A poll was conducted which showed a clear majority in favor of standardizing templating.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Need for Standardization:**  The discussion centered around whether a standardized templating mechanism is necessary, given existing proprietary solutions and the lack of a standard until now.  Arguments were made for the benefits of a standard in multi-vendor environments and for mitigating complexity when managing diverse devices.
*   **Scalability:**  The need for templates to improve the scalability of YANG models on large devices was raised, reducing memory footprint and configuration time.
*   **Existing Solutions:** Presentations highlighted different approaches to templating, including adding nodes, deletion, reordering, and even more complex looping and variable usage. A key point was the varying degree of "power" or flexibility offered by each approach.
*   **Validation:** A crucial distinction was made regarding whether templates should be validatable and what a system should do if a template application fails validation.
*   **Persistence:**  The distinction between "fire and forget" vs "persistent" templating solutions, where the system retains knowledge of template application, was discussed.
*   **Impact on YANG Models:** Discussion touched on whether templates should affect the YANG language itself (e.g., requiring updates to RFC 7950) or work independently of specific data models.  The use of metadata annotations was also discussed.
*   **Coexistence of Solutions**:  The possibility of annotating templates to indicate which mechanism the template is using.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Decision:** The working group agreed that standardization of a YANG templating mechanism is important and should be pursued.
*   **Action Item:** Authors are encouraged to continue developing their template ideas and to present them as drafts.
*   **Action Item:**  Continue discussion on the NETMOD mailing list to refine requirements and compare proposed solutions.
*   **Action Item:** Consider an interim meeting if the volume of discussion on the mailing list warrants it.  Otherwise, the topic will be revisited at IETF 122.

## Next Steps

*   Authors will submit drafts outlining their proposed templating solutions.
*   The working group will continue the discussion on the mailing list, focusing on specific requirements and the trade-offs between different approaches.
*   The possibility of an interim meeting will be evaluated based on the volume of discussion on the mailing list.
