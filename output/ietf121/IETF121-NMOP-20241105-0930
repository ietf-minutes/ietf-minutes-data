## Summary

This nmop meeting covered a range of topics related to network management operations, including terminology, digital maps (now C-maps), YANG push to message broker integration, incident management, and anomaly detection. The meeting included updates on existing drafts, discussions of open issues, and requests for feedback from the working group. Four "teaser" presentations of new work were also presented. Several key decisions were made regarding the adoption of drafts and the next steps for ongoing work.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Digital Map (C-map) Terminology:**
    *   The working group reached a consensus on renaming "Digital Map" to "Service and Infrastructure Maps" (C-maps).
    *   Adrian Farrell presented the rationale behind the name change and emphasized the importance of a clear definition for the new term.
    *   Discussions focused on defining the scope of C-maps and avoiding linguistic bias.
*   **C-map Concept and Requirements:**
    *   Olga presented updates on the C-map concept draft, including progress on terminology and use cases.
    *   Discussions centered on the need for defining topology, multi-layer topology vs. topology hierarchy, and describing use cases from an API perspective.
    *   The working group agreed to create a thread per requirement on the mailing list.
*   **YANG Push to Message Broker Integration:**
    *   Thomas presented updates on the YANG push to message broker integration draft.
    *   Discussions revolved around the need for a new YANG model for the metadata header and the importance of having a good wrap-up on the YANG push notification and capability side.
    *   Rob raised concerns about how the YANG schemas are validated and what the encoding is.
*   **Terminology Draft:**
    *   The working group discussed the progress of the terminology draft and its readiness for working group last call.
    *   The plan is to target a working group last call by the end of January next year.
    *   Adrian noted the importance of agreeing on or removing the last few terms that were recently added.
*   **Incident Manager YANG Module:**
    *   Chin presented updates on the incident manager YANG module.
    *   Discussions focused on aligning the module with the terminology draft.
    *   Clarification was provided on focusing on network-level incidents.
*   **Anomaly Detection Framework:**
    *   Alex and Vincenzo presented updates on the anomaly detection architecture, semantics for symptoms, and lifecycle drafts.
    *   Discussions revolved around knowledge graph integration, relevant state definition, and the structure of the model.
*   **Teaser Presentations:**
    *   Robert Peschi presented "Young Templates", a way to scale up models.
    *   A presenter presented "AI-based Network Management Agent (NMA)", which will integrate AI with network management.
    *   Rob Wilton presented "Yang Push Light", a more optimized version of Yang Push.
    *   Diego Lopez presented "Etsi initiative on data governance", an effort to converge different solutions to make data easily accessible.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Decision:** Rename "Digital Map" to "Service and Infrastructure Maps" (C-maps).
    *   **Action Item:** Update all documents to reflect the new terminology.
*   **Action Item:** Olga to create a thread per requirement for the C-map concept draft on the mailing list to gather feedback.
*   **Action Item:** Thomas to address JSON encoding issues and propose solutions in the next revision of the YANG push integration draft.
*   **Decision:** Target working group last call for the terminology draft by the end of January next year.
*   **Action Item:** Chin to work on the alignment with Network Anomaly drafts, and update the incident management draft.
*   **Decision:** Start an adoption call for the Network Economy Lifecycle and Semantic drafts.
*   **Action Item:** Address whether any TMF revisions are required for the incident model.
*   **Action Item:** Contact TMF about the incident young model.

## Next Steps

*   Authors to incorporate feedback received during the meeting into their respective drafts.
*   Working group members to review the drafts and provide feedback on the mailing list.
*   Schedule further interim meetings as needed to address specific issues.
