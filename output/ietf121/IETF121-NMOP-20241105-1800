## Summary

This NMOP working group session focused on Hackathon project reports covering three key experiments: Yang Push, Digital Map (C-Map), and Network Anomaly Lifecycle. A presentation was also given on Knowledge Graphs and their application to Yang models.  The presentations highlighted progress, challenges, and potential future work for each area.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Yang Push:**
    *   Validation of Yang Push publisher implementation for configured subscription, aiming for a fully automatable pipeline.
    *   Three vendor implementations (Cisco, Huawei, Sixwind) and two open-source receiver implementations were tested.
    *   Focus on end-to-end preservation of metadata, schema retrieval, versioning, and transport (UDP, HTTPS).
*   **Digital Map (C-Map):**
    *   Mapping network layers (L2, L3, ISIS, etc.) using RFC 8345.
    *   Integration of simulation/emulation scenarios for topology changes.
    *   Discovery labs at Swisscom and Telefonica.
    *   Linking topology information to configuration aspects and external data sources (e.g., RESTCONF).
    *   Concerns raised about complexity of using TE model as a core base model. Profile approach was discussed as a way to simplify the model for specific applications.
*   **T-E Topology Graphical Display:**
    *   Development of a Young toolkit for graphically displaying T-E topology JSON instances.
    *   Demonstrated bi-directional links, multi-layer topologies (OTN/WDM), and underlay paths related to overlay links.
    *   Discussion of the concept of a profile for simplifying complex models like T-Topology.
    *   Debate about whether the complexity of T-Topology makes it unsuitable as a core model for CMAP.  Need for a core model to be general enough to be augmented to include T-E topologies.
*   **Network Anomaly Lifecycle:**
    *   Presentation of Antagonist, an open-source label store project for validating lifecycle drafts.
    *   Focus on enabling detection systems to improve over time by exchanging data between different stages of the lifecycle.
    *   Integration with rule-based anomaly detection (RFC 9418) and machine learning-based algorithms.
    *   Young model updates to better formalize the connection between metrics and symptoms.
    *   Future work involves refactoring the API using ChatGPT, exploring NoSQL databases, and integrating with the Swisscom Lab.
*   **Knowledge Graph (Yang to RDF):**
    *   Created a Yang to RDF transformer using Xtext and Eclipse Modeling Framework.
    *   Supports full grammar, all features including augmentations, grouping, and extensions.
    *   Addresses comments about RDF and Yang being potential barriers.
    *   Code is open source.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   The C-Map team will further develop how to connect to external data sources.
*   The C-Map and T-E topology teams will coordinate to have a more unified set of goals for the next Hackathon, enabling comparisons.
*   The Anomaly Lifecycle team will explore refactoring the API and investigate NoSQL databases.
*   Participants expressed interest in collaborating on the Anomaly Lifecycle project through pilots, tests, and lab access.

## Next Steps

*   The C-Map team will add more layers (BGP, Service X, etc.).
*   The Anomaly Lifecycle team will work towards integrating with the Swisscom Lab for the next Hackathon.
*   The Yang to RDF team will complete the partial translation of auto-generated IRAs.
