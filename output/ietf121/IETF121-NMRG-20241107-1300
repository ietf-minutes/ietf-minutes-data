## Summary
This meeting of the NMRG focused on several key topics: IBM use case consolidation, energy-aware security research directions, autonomic control loops for network slice reconfiguration, and data quality challenges in machine learning-based intrusion detection systems (IDS). The group discussed the adoption of a consolidated IBM use case draft, explored future research on energy-aware security, and examined methods for autonomic network slice reconfiguration using AI and NLP. A significant portion of the meeting was dedicated to the challenges of data quality and evaluation in machine learning-based IDS, with presentations on improving test set quality and assessing the impact of data quality on model performance.

## Key Discussion Points
*   **IBM Use Case Draft:** Discussion around merging multiple IBM-related drafts into a single document. Concerns were raised about individual draft development and the need for clarity on the content included in the collective document.
*   **Energy-Aware Security:** Presentation on future research directions for energy-aware security mechanisms, focusing on measuring the energy consumption of security protocols and the trade-offs between security, performance, and energy usage. The right venue for this research within the IETF/IRTF was debated.
*   **Autonomic Control Loop for Network Slicing:** Presentation on using an autonomic control loop with automated planning and NLP to achieve self-reconfiguration in sliced networks. The discussion focused on the translation of natural language intents into machine-understandable instructions.
*   **Data Quality in IDS:** Three presentations highlighted issues with data quality and evaluation in machine learning-based IDS. The discussions covered topics such as overfitting, the lack of variability and complexity in existing datasets, and methods for improving test set quality.
*   **Test Set Quality and Realism:** The challenges in creating realistic test sets for IDS were emphasized. The limitations of lab-based evaluations and the need for better datasets representative of real-world traffic were discussed.
*   **Model Interpretability:** The importance of model interpretability for understanding the behavior of machine learning-based IDS and identifying potential data quality issues was highlighted.

## Decisions and Action Items
*   **IBM Use Case Draft Adoption:** Proceed with a call for adoption of the consolidated IBM use case draft on the mailing list.  Clarify the status of Luis's individual drafts before the IRG review.
*   **Jefferson's Energy-Aware Security Draft:** Jefferson to consider incorporating research questions into his draft and assess the best venue for the work (NMERG or other groups).
*   **Data Quality in IDS:**  The group acknowledged the need for better datasets and evaluation methodologies for machine learning-based IDS.

## Next Steps
*   The co-chairs will initiate the call for adoption of the IBM use case draft on the mailing list.
*   Jefferson will refine his energy-aware security draft and consider the appropriate venue for further work.
*   The group will continue the discussion on AI network management during the Friday session.
*   Discussions on data quality and evaluation methods in IDS will continue on the mailing list and in future meetings.
