## Summary

The OAuth working group meeting covered several topics including token status lists, attestation-based client authentication, transaction tokens, and a proposal for client-specific authorization server metadata. Discussions centered on specification improvements, addressing open issues, and exploring future directions for each area.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Token Status List (TSL):**
    *   Discussion on removing support for unsigned JSON/CBOR status lists to simplify the specification. Concerns were raised about forcing cryptographic protection for all status lists and the group decided to confirm consensus on the mailing list.
    *   Debate on adding options for compression algorithms, with a final consensus against adding additional algorithm options, in favor of sticking with Zlib for simplicity and implementation ease.
    *   Discussion on content type requirements for status lists. Concerns were raised about compatibility with systems that don't support proper content types. Justin Richer argued strongly that the standard should adhere to HTTP's content negotiation, so must be mandated.
*   **Attestation-Based Client Authentication:**
    *   The group decided to split concerns for trusting clients vs trusting attestation keys.
    *   Discussion on nonce mechanisms to prevent replay attacks, leveraging learnings from the OpenID for VC group with an option to allow the client opt for a specific nonce or new nonce. George noted that we need to define a common nonce solution. Justin Richer responded that the nonce must be in context of the protocol and cryptographic carrier.
    *   Plans to include depop optimization, where the same key can be used both for client attestation and depop for efficiency.
*   **Transaction Tokens:**
    *   Discovery of transaction token service (TTS) endpoint: Should it be baked in the authorization server, configured out of band, or rely on some discovery mechanism?
    *   Deployment models for TTS were discussed, including embedded, centralized, and distributed models. The group decided to raise the topic on the WIMS mailing list to solicit feedback on relevant deployment models.
    *   Discussion on how batch processing cases would interact with transaction tokens.
    *   Agreement to use the "Authorization Details" claim from RAR (Rich Authorization Requests) at the top level of the transaction token for authorization details.
*   **Client ID Hint Presentations:**
    *   Presentation of a proposal to allow authorization servers to serve different metadata depending on the client ID provided in the metadata request.
    *   Discussion on potential deployment challenges and security/privacy implications of dynamic AS metadata discovery. Justin Richer mentioned webfinger failures and deployments issues with it.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Token Status List (TSL):**
    *   **Decision:** Remove support for unsigned JSON/CBOR status lists. (Confirm on mailing list)
    *   **Decision:** Stick with Zlib for compression, without additional algorithm options. (Confirm on mailing list)
    *   **Decision:** Content-type will be specified as a must in the spec.
    *   **Action Item:** Schedule an interim meeting in early December to review progress and finalize the specification.
    *   **Action Item:** Authors to address the open issues and editorial pass.
*   **Attestation-Based Client Authentication:**
    *   **Action Item:** Authors to work on open issues.
    *   **Action Item:** Authors to define a nonces endpoint, leveraging what was learned in open ID for ECI.
    *   **Action Item:** Consider leveraging findings to make a common nonce solution.
*   **Transaction Tokens:**
    *   **Action Item:** Raise deployment model questions on the WIMS mailing list to gather more feedback.
    *   **Action Item:** Add "Authorization Details" claim from RAR to the top level of the transaction token.
*   **Client ID Hint Presentations:**
    *   **Action Item:** Continue discussion and potentially explore the proposal further based on community feedback.

## Next Steps

*   Authors of each draft will work on addressing the open issues and feedback received during the meeting.
*   The working group will schedule an interim meeting in early December to review the Token Status List and Attestation-Based Client Authentication drafts.
*   The Transaction Tokens deployment model will be raised on the WIMS mailing list for further discussion.
*   The idea of the Client ID hint presentation will be further fleshed out and then the community will weigh in on whether it is a good idea or not.
