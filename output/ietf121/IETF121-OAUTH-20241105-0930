## Summary

This meeting covered several key topics, including Identity Chaining, OAuth for First-Party Apps, Client ID Metadata Documents, and updates to OAuth 2.1.  A significant portion of the meeting was dedicated to a discussion of Identity Chaining and the challenges related to sender-constrained tokens.  The group also discussed the OAuth 2.1 update.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Identity Chaining & Confirmation Key Transfer:** The session focused on a solution to enable sending constraint tokens across trust domains.
    *   Two deployment scenarios were presented: Resource server acting as client, and Authorization server acting as client.
    *   Discussion arose about the necessity and applicability of the "requested CNF" claim. It's primarily needed when the authorization server acts as the client.
    *   It was pointed out that binding the authorization grant is different from binding the final access token and involves different facilities.
    *   Dean Sacks requested clearer labeling/numbering of resource servers, access tokens, and steps in the diagrams for future presentations.

*   **OAuth for First-Party Apps:** A draft focused on improving the user experience for native mobile apps by leveraging existing authorization code flow building blocks.
    *   A key question was whether to incorporate passkeys into the draft directly or keep them as an extension.
    *   Dean Sacks suggested keeping WebAuthn separate from the main draft, as the authentication aspect is out of scope.
    *   There was a debate about whether the first blue arrow represents PAR (Pushed Authorization Requests), and whether it should be a goal to reuse PAR. Concerns were raised about the potential for breaking existing PAR implementations.

*   **Client ID Metadata Document:**  A new approach was presented to allow clients to provide metadata through alternative methods to out-of-band registration or dynamic client registration.
    *   Neil Jenkins argued that Dynamic Client Registration can be a better approach for some use cases with careful implementation.
    *   Concerns were raised about using HTTP URLs as client IDs, as it could conflict with existing specifications like OpenID Federation and create potential security issues.
    *   There was discussion around the UI and whether users will truly understand what they are authorizing based on the domain name displayed.
    *   Justin Richer highlighted the risks of using URL claiming and shared anecdotes from open ID.
    *   George noted that DCR can be combined with client attestation and deed to get results close to those.

*   **OAuth 2.1 Update:**  A brief update on the progress of the OAuth 2.1 specification.
    *   It was noted that the string "bearer" in the token type header is case-insensitive.
    *   The aim is to get the specification in shape for a working group call at the start of the next year.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Identity Chaining:**
    *   Authors to address feedback on requested CNF, inaccurate diagrams and client terminology and publish a new draft to Datatracker.
    *   Tony, Aaron, and George volunteered to review the updated draft.
    *   Document author to include description of assumptions on interapplication access within security considerations.
*   **OAuth for First-Party Apps:**
    *   Tim Cappalli to refine the implementation with webauthN.
    *   Dean, Andy and Kelly to review the draft.
    *   The question of whether to use PAR or not is tracked as an issue.
    *   Authors to explore with BlueSky regarding what research has been done for this.
*   **Client ID Metadata Document:**
    *   Address feedback and concerns raised about the design.

## Next Steps

*   The Identity Chaining authors will incorporate feedback and publish a revised draft. Reviewers will then provide their input.
*   Tim Cappalli will be incorporating feedback into the first-party apps draft, and reviewers will look at that.
*   The First-Party Apps team will track the issue about whether to use PAR or not.
*   The Client ID Metadata Document team will address the feedback and concerns and continue development.
*   The OAuth 2.1 team will work through the remaining open issues and aim for a working group last call in early 2024.
