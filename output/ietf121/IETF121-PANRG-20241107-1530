## Summary

The Passive and Active Measurement Research Group (panrg) session covered four presentations: Network Attestation for Secure Routing (NASR), updates on the Scion architecture and deployments, and Sidekick, a scheme for in-network assistance. Discussions focused on technical details, security considerations, deployment challenges, and potential synergies with other IETF efforts like the scone working group.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Network Attestation for Secure Routing (NASR):**
    *   The presentation focused on auditing network paths and ensuring traffic transits trusted devices, addressing scenarios where VPNs and other security measures may not be sufficient.
    *   Discussion revolved around proof of transit vs. proof of non-transit. It was clarified that proving non-transit is much more difficult and may not be solvable within the IETF.
    *   Concerns were raised about the name, "Routing Security", and whether it should be reserved for routing protocol related topics.
    *   The presenters were encouraged to talk to physical layer security experts regarding the work they are doing.
*   **Scion Updates:**
    *   Updates on the core Scion components, research questions, and deployment issues. The goal is to document the current deployments.
    *   Discussion focused on inter-domain bandwidth reservation.
    *   Clarification on isolation domains in Scion: isolation is about trust, needing TRC mutual trust for communication.
    *   There was a question about guidance to N-RENs for connectivity to multiple customers.
*   **Science Global Research and Education Network:**
    *   Discussion on challenges deploying research network and the initiative to provide universities and research institutions access to the science production network.
    *   Scalability of the deployment and the five year vision was discussed.
*   **Sidekick: In-Network Assistance**
    *   Presentation on Sidekick, a scheme for in-network assistance for protocols like Quick, aiming to address performance issues in flaky network conditions without modifying the base protocol.
    *   Discussions revolved around the threat model, including potential for an on-path intermediary to induce congestion control backoff.
    *   Suggestions were made to consider synergy with the scone working group, especially regarding credible threats of network violence.
    *   The potential for a side meeting on on-path proxy discovery was proposed.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **NASR:**
    *   The NASR team will need to clarify the scope and what they can prove, specifically regarding proof of transit vs. proof of non-transit.
    *   Consider name change to avoid confusion with traditional routing security.
*   **Scion:**
    *   Provide guidance for an organization providing connectivity to multiple customers (N-RENs), specifically guidance for establishing single vs multiple ISDs.
*   **Sidekick:**
    *   The Sidekick team was encouraged to coordinate with the scone working group to discuss the threat model and identify potential synergies.

## Next Steps

*   **NASR:** The next BOFF will be in Bangkok
*   A side meeting on on-path proxy discovery was scheduled for the current IETF meeting.
*   The Panergy chairs will discuss how to structure the room over the next three months.
