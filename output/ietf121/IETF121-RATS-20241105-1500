## Summary

The RATS working group meeting covered three main topics: Concise Reference Integrity Manifest (CORIM), Conceptual Message Wrappers (CMW), and handling multiple verifiers in Remote Attestation procedureS (RAS). The CORIM presentation focused on updates and clarifications to the draft, especially around security version numbers and the introduction of measurement multiplicity. The CMW presentation discussed progress on the draft, incorporating security considerations and a proposed change to the typing system. The final presentation explored the use cases and architecture for handling multiple verifiers, addressing resilience and interoperability concerns.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **CORIM:**
    *   Clarification on security version number (SVN) updates.
    *   Tidying up triples and defining security considerations for verifier operations.
    *   Introduction of measurement multiplicity to represent multiple measured elements within an environment.
    *   Discussion on a tie-in between the Skit work and KORIM, potentially through guidance documentation.
*   **CMW:**
    *   Second working group last call completed, progressing from version 06 to 10.
    *   Incorporation of security considerations based on Lawrence's feedback.
    *   Discussion on tightening the type system, potentially removing pre-registered Cibor tags.
    *   Deb expresses reservations about TN tags.
*   **Multiple Verifiers:**
    *   Exploration of use cases for multiple verifiers, including resilience and interoperability.
    *   Discussion on whether multiple verifiers can be replaced by a single, conceptual verifier.
    *   Addressing how to handle potentially contradicting attestation results from different verifiers (Byzantine general's problem).
    *   DAA draft may offer a scalable alternative to multiple attestations

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **CMW:**
    *   **Decision:**  Need to make a decision on the type system topic (TN tags vs. pre-registered Cibor tags).
    *   **Action Item:**  Authors to perform surgery on the draft based on the type system decision and publish a new version.
*   **Multiple Verifiers:**
	*  **Action Item:** Further discussion on handling multiple verifiers should occur on the mailing list and during the open mic session on Friday

## Next Steps

*   **CORIM:**  Encourage participants to review the draft and provide feedback.
*   **CMW:**
    *   Resolve the type system issue.
    *   Publish a new version of the draft.
*   **Attester Groups:** Further collaboration with the DA authors to investigate a scalability use case
