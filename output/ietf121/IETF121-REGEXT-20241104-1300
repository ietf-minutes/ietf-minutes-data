## Summary

This meeting of the Registration Protocols Extensions Working Group (regext) covered several topics, including ARDAP extensions for enhancing existing protocols and security. Presentations included updates on ARDEP extensions, an RPKI extension proposal, a TTL extension proposal, implementation experiences with EPP, and a security proposal for EPP domain transfers (AltCodeSec). The group also discussed a domain variant support extension for EPP. Finally, there was a discussion around the design choices in the Resource Identity System (RIS) draft and their compatibility with core ARDAP RFCs.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **ARDAP Extensions Draft:** Clarification of how ARDAP extensions are specified, and addressing non-compliant extensions. Discussion centered on codifying harmless deviations from standards versus disallowing them. Emphasis on avoiding email threads about extensions.
*   **RPKI Extension for ARDAP:** Proposal for adoption discussed. RPKI (Resource Public Key Infrastructure) registration data available through ARDAP would complement troubleshooting tools and visualize the RPKI hierarchy. Clarification that this extension must not be used to directly influence internet routing.
*   **TTL Extension for ARDAP:** Concerns raised about including TTL information in ARDAP that is publicly available in DNS. Discussion about potential for observer confusion due to TTLs varying. Implementation issues related to syncing data between registry database and DNS were discussed.
*   **EPP over HTTP/3 and Quick:** Implementation experiences shared. Java HP client class and a Quick K-W-I-K library were used. Discussion about lazy stream creation in Quick and the need for an "EO key Connection Start" message.
*   **AltCodeSec (Domain Transfer Security):** Presentation of a security enhancement for EPP domain transfers using public key authentication. Discussions involved public key management, security concerns, and backwards compatibility.
*   **EPP Domain Variant Support:** This presentation was seeking adoption. The need to support IDN variants and that support is optional. There are backward compatibility requirements. Statuses of label that can be managed individually.
*   **Resource Identity System (RIS) Draft:** Discussion around the draft's unconventional approach of using multiple extension identifiers (five) and bare path segments. Concerns about compliance with RFC 9082 and the use of bare members in JSON.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **ARDAP Extensions Draft:** Andy Newton will incorporate feedback from James Gold regarding extension styles.
*   **General Workload Prioritization:** The group will discuss prioritizing existing drafts versus adopting new work at the next meeting.
*   **EPP over HTTP/3 and Quick:** Jim Gold will look at the possibility of getting the client certificate from the stream.
*   **EPP Domain Variant Support:** This will be brought to the mailing list for adoption. It will point to the LGR the not mandated and that that should be a one way to do it.
*   **Resource Identity System (RIS) Draft:** Continue discussion on the mailing list

## Next Steps

*   Discuss prioritization of existing drafts at the next meeting.
*   Review and discuss the adoption requests on the mailing list.
*   Continue discussions on the RIS design choices on the mailing list.
