# regext

## Summary

This was the second of two regext meetings, focusing on administrative matters and a review of the working group's current document status. The meeting covered document progress, discussed the ordering and prioritization of documents, and addressed milestones. Discussions also included the use of experimental documents and the future direction of various drafts.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **RDAP Extensions and Versioning:** The group agreed that the RDAP extensions draft should be completed before the RDAP X Media Type and versioning drafts. Versioning and X Media Type drafts will be released together as they have normative references to each other.
*   **Use of Internationalized Email Addresses in EPP:** This document is ready for working group last call, after a previous remand from the IESG and subsequent cleanup of Datatracker status. Jody will update the document shepherd write-up.
*   **RDAP Extension:** The document needs an update to incorporate mailing list discussions. The updated version should be reviewed before proceeding to working group last call.
*   **Using JS Contact in RDAP:** This document will be progressed as an experimental document. A public record (via the mailing list) defining the success criteria for the experiment will be created.
*   **Milestones:** The chairs presented an overview of current and proposed milestones. Discussion focused on prioritizing documents, including EOH/EOQ, and managing the workload given the limited number of active reviewers.
*   **EOH and EOQ:** Despite being similar, it was confirmed that the EOH and EOQ documents should remain separate due to potentially different usage scenarios and transport characteristics.
*   **Domain Variant EPP:** Discussed the soft correlation between the IDN variant EPP work and the ICANN's new GTLD program. The need for potentially an ARDAP version of the document was raised.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Decision:**  Release RDAP Extensions draft before the X Media Type and versioning drafts.  Release Versioning and X Media Type drafts together.
*   **Decision:** Proceed with working group last call for the "Use of Internationalized Email Addresses in EPP" document.
*   **Action Item (Jody):** Update the document shepherd write-up for the "Use of Internationalized Email Addresses in EPP" document.
*   **Action Item (Andy):** Update the RDAP Extension document based on mailing list discussions.
*   **Action Item (Mario):**  Create an email message for the mailing list defining the success criteria for the "Using JS Contact in RDAP" experiment and start a discussion thread.
*   **Action Item (Chairs):** Update the milestone list, taking into account the agreed-upon document order and prioritization and publish them to the mailing list.
*   **Action Item (Chairs):** Remove expired "Coding of REG-ID" milestone.

## Next Steps

*   The chairs will update and publish the milestone list.
*   The working group will proceed with working group last calls in the agreed-upon order.
*   Authors will continue to work on their documents, incorporating feedback from the working group.
