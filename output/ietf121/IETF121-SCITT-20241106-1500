# scitt

## Summary
The scitt working group meeting covered the architecture document status, recent transparency activity, progress on the Scrappy API, and integration with the VCON working group. The group agreed to proceed with a working group last call for the architecture document and continue using the GitHub process for interims.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **SCIT Architecture Overview:** Hank provided an overview of the SCIT architecture, highlighting the use of COSI, verifiable data structures, and hash envelopes. He emphasized the role of the issuer, transparency service (e-notary), and relying party.
*   **Transparency in the News:** Orie Steele discussed recent transparency activities in the industry, including the Transparency Dev Summit, government initiatives (EO 14110), and applications in critical infrastructure and software supply chains. He highlighted the use of Skit principles in other transparency initiatives.
*   **SCIT Architecture Progress:** Steve Lasker reported on improvements to the architecture document, addressing issues raised by Hannes and others, cleaning up CDDL examples, and refining the diagram. The diagram was updated to reflect role assignments during statement verification. He emphasized that signed statements exist prior to the transparency service.
*   **Scrappy API Progress:** Steve Grove presented the status of the Scrappy API. A significant portion of open issues are addressed by existing PRs. Key topics included Seabor conversion, problem details objects (using RFC 9220), and long-running registration processes. The removal of the resolve statement endpoint was proposed.
*   **Scrappy API Identifiers and Semantics:** Discussion regarding identifier meaning and semantics, with a move away from deriving locators from object content.
*   **Scrappy API Issue Signs Statement Endpoint:** There was a discussion and support for the `issue signs statement` endpoint and vendor lock-in avoidance.
*   **Hackathon Report:** Steve Grove reported on the hackathon, including a new Python implementation of RFC 9190 and Scrappy, improvements to the Scrappy spec, and integration with VECON. Noteworthy was the successful use of ChatGPT for Seabor conversion. He also suggested tooling improvements for debugging Seabor.
*   **VCON Integration:** Thomas Hardjono presented the integration of Scrappy with VCON, using VCON use cases to test the Scrappy API. Use cases included the creation, ownership changes, redaction, and consent revocation of VCONs. The VCON ID and issuer are included as CWT claims in the protected header.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Decision:** The working group agreed to proceed with a working group last call for the architecture document.
*   **Action Item:** Authors to prepare the architecture document for working group last call.
*   **Decision:** The working group agreed to continue using the GitHub process for interims unless specific planned interims are required.

## Next Steps

*   Initiate working group last call for the architecture document.
*   Continue addressing open issues in the Scrappy API specification.
*   Further investigate and address the identifier semantics.
*   Continue testing Scrappy API with VCON use cases.
