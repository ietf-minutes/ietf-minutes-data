# sidrops

## Summary
This session of the sidrops working group covered two main topics: Manifest Numbers and a next-generation RPKI transport, and Constraining RPKI Trust Anchors. The Manifest Numbers discussion focused on a draft addressing the potential for manifest number exhaustion and aimed for working group last call. The next-generation RPKI transport discussion explored the potential benefits and drawbacks of existing transport mechanisms (R-Sync and RRDP) and proposed a requirements-driven approach for developing a new transport. The Constraining RPKI Trust Anchors presentation discussed approaches to locally constrain trust anchors, and requested feedback from the working group.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Manifest Numbers:**
    *   The current mechanism relies on incrementing a manifest number, but it has a limited range and can stall if the maximum value is reached.
    *   The proposed solution involves resetting the manifest number when the manifest filename changes.
    *   There was a discussion regarding deprecating the manifest number check entirely, but the consensus was that it's useful for diagnostics and provides a safeguard against invalid restores from backup.
    *   Concerns were raised and addressed that CA regression would be a problem, and suggestion made that CAs should do a key rollover in these situations.

*   **Next-Generation RPKI Transport:**
    *   R-Sync and RRDP both have advantages and disadvantages. R-Sync offers resilience and local bandwidth performance, while RRDP provides transport security and CDN compatibility.
    *   It was suggested to develop a requirements document that outlines the desired properties of a next-generation transport, as opposed to diving directly into specific solutions.
    *   Requirements mentioned included direct access to individual objects, bandwidth efficiency, RPKI-aware compression, resumption capabilities, and minimizing the need for snapshot generation.
    *   A small group has already volunteered to write an individual submission capturing transport requirements.
    *   Rob Austine thought that criticisms were implementation related.
    *   Andy Newton asked why not just patch RDP?
    *   George Michaelson suggested that best current practices documents could be used to describe best practices.

*   **Constraining RPKI Trust Anchors:**
    *   Relying parties may want to limit the scope of trust they place in a given trust anchor.
    *   One approach is to use local configuration to allow or deny specific Internet Number Resources (INRs) under a trust anchor.
    *   Another approach is the NRO Experimental Trust Anchor, which signs over the public keys of the RER's trust anchor certificates and imposes constraints specific to each RAR.
    *   Problems with the current RPKI validation algorithm prevent the NRO experimental trust anchor from being readily used.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Manifest Numbers:**
    *   The presenter will consider adding recommendations for CAs regarding key rollover in the case of resource regression, possibly in a best current practice document.
    *   Aim for working group last call.
*   **Next-Generation RPKI Transport:**
    *   A small group will continue working on the individual submission capturing transport requirements for an next-gen transport.
*   **Constraining RPKI Trust Anchors**
    *   It may be helpful to turn this into an informational RFC
    *   The working group should consider the document and its usefulness in the future

## Next Steps

*   **Manifest Numbers:**
    *   Address feedback from the discussion.
    *   Move to working group last call.

*   **Next-Generation RPKI Transport:**
    *   The small group will publish a first version of the transport requirements document and solicit feedback from stakeholders.
    *   Working group to further discuss requirements and potential solutions.

*   **Constraining RPKI Trust Anchors:**
    *   Working group to consider further exploration of a locally configured policy that relying party operators can impose on the outcome of the relying party implementation
    *   Publish document via the independent stream
