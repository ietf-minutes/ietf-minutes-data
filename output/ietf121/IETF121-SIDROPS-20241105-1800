## Summary

This session covered several topics related to RPKI and route security. Presentations included discussions on ASRA (Autonomous System Relationship Authorization), CSP (Connectivity Security Policy) objects, route partial visibility, route origin registry, and RPKI repository issues.  Significant discussion focused on the need for ASRA given existing mechanisms like BGPSEC and the operational complexities of new RPKI objects. Other topics covered proposed solutions to known issues.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **ASRA (Autonomous System Relationship Authorization):**
    *   Purpose: Detect forged peering links not detectable by ASPA alone.
    *   Mechanism:  Combines with ASPA to verify BGP peering links.
    *   Debate:  Ben Winter argued that lying transit providers are rare and BGPSEC is the better solution to address concerns about falsified path information.  Charam addressed issues where ASRA would resolve vulnerabilities that ASPA can't.
    *   Operational Complexity: Concerns raised by Warren Kumari; need to finalize ASPA before considering ASRA.
    *   Deployment: Antwerp raised questions about deployment before ASPA, clarifying the need to deploy together.
*   **CSP (Connectivity Security Policy) Objects:**
    *   Purpose: Enable remote pinning and automatic peering for subnet adopting ASes.
    *   Updates: Addressed comments from Ross re: ASN.1 format, class names, and address families.
*   **Route Partial Visibility:**
    *   Problem: Even with correct ROAs, partial route visibility can lead to vulnerabilities.
    *   Types: Unilateral, SPDO, DPSO, DPDO.
    *   Causes: Route filtering, route aggregation.
    *   Mitigation: Local mitigation by each AS using ASPA and RPI level filtering of suspicious routes.
*   **Route Origin Registry:**
    *   Problem: Limitations of existing IRR and RPKI data sources for multi-origin AS announcements.
    *   Proposed Solutions: Multi-party governance, leverage multiple data sources, cross-verification, anomaly detection.
    *   Debate: Question about the necessity of a new system versus simply creating more ROAs to authorize multiple origin ASNs.
*   **RPKI Repository Issues:**
    *   Problems: Reliability, scalability, and security issues with current RPKI repository design.
    *   Proposed Solutions: Distributed data storage, preventing unlimited PP growth, malicious behavior detection, complete RPKI object view, audit functions.
    *   Concerns raised about operational practices and need for better training and guidance.
## Decisions and Action Items

*   ASRA: Review feedback and consider potential refinements, further discussion needed within the working group.
*   Route Origin Registry: Author to consider feedback and re-evaluate the need for a new system given existing RPKI capabilities.
*   Presentations cut short due to running out of time.

## Next Steps

*   Continue discussion on the mailing list for ASRA, route origin registry, and RPKI repository issues.
*   Reschedule remaining presentations for a future session.
*   Working group to focus on deploying and finalizing ASPA.
