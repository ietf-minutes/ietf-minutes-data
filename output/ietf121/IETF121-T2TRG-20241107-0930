# t2trg

## Summary

The Thing-to-Thing Research Group (t2trg) met at IETF-121 to discuss ongoing research related to the Internet of Things (IoT), focusing on low-resource devices, interoperability, security, and emerging areas like sustainability. The meeting included updates on group documents, hackathon activities, and presentations on data model conversion (SDF and Matter), data sharing (SenML and CoreConf), secure group communication with CoAP, onion routing, and secure device onboarding.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Group Document Status:** Four drafts are nearing publication, including guidance on RESTful design for IoT, CoAP amplification attacks, terminator process for initial security setup, and a taxonomy of operational security considerations. Reviews are encouraged.
*   **Hackathon Activity:** Work focused on semantic definition format (SDF) extensions for mapping non-IP devices (BLE, CIP) and converting Matter models to/from SDF.
*   **Data Model Interoperability:** Presentations highlighted efforts to convert interaction models between SDF and Matter, and to represent SenML data using Yang and CoreConf for efficient encoding and interoperability. The use of zero for the SenML "name" identifier and whether this breaks Yang constraints was raised as an issue.
*   **Secure Group Communication:** Discussed architecture and components for secure group communication with CoAP, including Group OSCORE, proxies, and access control mechanisms built on ACE framework.
*   **Onion Routing:** Presented a method for building onion routing from Core building blocks to enable anonymous communication. Questions were raised about recent Tor attacks and potential mitigations.
*   **Secure Device Onboarding:** Summarized NIST's efforts to bring together industry for secure onboarding of IoT devices, including different protocols and credential provisioning.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Group Documents:** Chairs will encourage discussion on mailing list regarding opportunities for more detail in the operational security document.
*   **Demonstration Follow-up:** Organize an event for a live demo of the SDF to Matter converter, potentially after wiki and thesis release.
*   **Follow-up Meeting:** Schedule a follow-up meeting to further discuss data model interoperability (SDF/Matter, SenML/CoreConf).
*   **Follow-up Meeting:** Schedule a follow-up meeting to further discuss secure group communication topics.
*   **Onion Routing Draft:** Add use cases to onion routing draft.
*   **SenML/CoreConf Draft:** Take into account Alex' suggestion on expressing the "N" identifier in SenML/CoreConf draft.

## Next Steps

*   Authors to continue refinement of group documents based on feedback.
*   Chairs to schedule follow-up meetings on data model interoperability and security topics.
*   Nicholas to finish wiki for demo and potentially release his bachelor's thesis.
*   Consider a table of contents for Internet Drafts.
*   Investigate issues of sustainability, reusability and re-sizing in IoT devices.
*   Explore further collaborations with STOs, including OMA.
