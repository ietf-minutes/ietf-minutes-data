## Summary

This TLS working group meeting at IETF 121 covered a range of topics, including updates on the Trust Anchor ID effort, registry updates, ECH clarifications, bridge certificate compression, extended key update, SSH key log, and post-quantum cipher suites. Key discussions revolved around deadlines for Trust Anchor ID proposals, ECH public name validation, FAT membership and deliberation process, DTLS 1.3 clarifications, and the adoption of post-quantum cipher suites.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Trust Anchor IDs:**
    *   A new deadline of December 20th was set for submitting proposals for Trust Anchor IDs.
    *   There was disagreement regarding delaying the adoption call until January, with some arguing for immediate action given the previous interim and the potential for new drafts to influence the adopted solution.
*   **ECH Public Name Validation:**
    *   Discussion focused on the validation of public names within ECH configurations, specifically regarding the inclusion/exclusion of IP addresses and the application of DNS rules.
    *   Concerns were raised about potential inconsistencies between URI parsers and TLS layers.
    *   Area director to provide text to clarify validation rules.
*   **FAT Membership and Deliberation:**
    *   The private nature of FAT deliberations was questioned, with some advocating for more openness and consistency with IETF ethos.
    *   Concerns were raised about the accessibility and influence of FAT members, particularly regarding the application of formal analysis.
    *   A "point person" will be assigned for each draft. The chairs will reach out to the FAT to see if they will open up deliberations.
*   **DTLS 1.3 Clarifications:**
    *   David Benjamin highlighted 13 issues needing addressing, including key update handling, ACK behavior, epoch management, and zero RTT data transmission.
    *   A DTLS 1.3 bis document is planned to address these issues.
*   **Bridge Certificate Compression:**
    *   Changes to the bridge certificate draft were proposed, including switching to Brotley compression and integrating a versioned list of WebPKI CA certificates.
    *   Experimentation results would determine next steps.
*   **Extended Key Update:**
    *   Updates included enhancements to the response mechanism, SSL key log updates, and exporter considerations.
*   **Post-Quantum Cipher Suites:**
    *   Discussion centered on two registered code points for post-quantum hybrid cipher suites, including FIPS compliance considerations and the order of key exchanges.
    *   NIST is being consulted on reordering of keys.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Trust Anchor IDs:** Deadline set for December 20th for draft submissions, with an adoption call planned for early January.
*   **ECH Public Name Validation:** Area director to provide updated text on validation rules. Eckert will change the MUST to MAY for 63 bytes.
*   **FAT Membership and Deliberation:** Chair to ask the FAT about opening the deliberations. A "point person" will be assigned for each draft.
*   **DTLS 1.3:** Plan to create a DTLS 1.3 bis document to address identified issues.
*   **Bridge Certificate Compression:** Continue with proposed changes and evaluate performance impact through experimentation. Experimentation can be completed in weeks.
*   **Extended Key Update:** Proceed with SNIF test.
*   **SSL Key Log:** Start Working Group Last Call.
*   **Post-Quantum Cipher Suites:** Chair to address adoptation of cipher suites on the mailing list.
*   **All drafts:** Draft authors should express the security requirements.

## Next Steps

*   Chairs to send a message to the list.
*   Authors to update drafts and address open issues.
*   Chairs to schedule FAT SNIF tests and Working Group Last Calls as appropriate.
*   Monitor experimentation results for Bridge Certificates.
*   Consult with NIST regarding post-quantum cipher suite key exchange order.
