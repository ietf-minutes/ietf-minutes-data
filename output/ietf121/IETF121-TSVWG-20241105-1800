## Summary

This TSVWG session focused on L4S operations, interop events, and SCTP with DTLS. Key discussions included the presentation of a video demonstrating the impact of low latency on live sports broadcasts and an update on ongoing L4S interoperability testing. The session also addressed compatibility issues between L4S senders and certain bottleneck types, and the working group discussed how to move forward with DTLS over SCTP, unadopting a previous solution and adopting a multi-document approach leveraging existing IETF standards and potentially new work in the TLS working group.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **L4S and Live Sports:** A demonstration highlighted the significant differences in latency between various video delivery methods (satellite, OTT, low-latency lab setup), with implications for sports fans and sports gambling.
*   **L4S Interoperability Testing:**  Updates were provided on ongoing L4S interop events, including those held at IETF and Cable Labs. Netflix, Google, and NVIDIA have been actively testing their implementations. A WebRTC interoperability issue was discovered and led to an errata for RFC 88.
*   **L4S Compatibility Issues:** Discussion continued on the L4S ops draft addressing compatibility issues between L4S senders and certain bottleneck types.
*   **DTLS over SCTP Solutions:** Multiple solutions were presented but all have different issues. A new approach based on an encryption/decryption component and a separate key management component, the latter leveraging existing IETF standards (DTLS) or work in TLS working group (extended key update). This approach has the potential to avoid IPR concerns.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **L4S Ops Draft:** Update the milestone to April 2025 to allow for potential input from IESG review and further deployment experiences. Encourage contributions to the draft.
*   **DTLS over SCTP:**
    *   **Decision:** Unadopt the existing "DTLS over SCTP" draft (draft-ietf-tsvwg-dtls-sctp-08) as a working group item.
    *   **Action Item:** Editors to produce revision zero of the encryption/decryption and key management drafts by the end of the year for WG consideration.
    *   **Action Item:** Chairs will send a summary of decisions and planned actions in the meeting to the mailing list.

## Next Steps

*   Continue L4S interoperability testing this week at IETF and in the coming weeks at Cable Labs.
*   Authors to produce initial drafts of the new DTLS over SCTP proposal for working group adoption.
*   The working group will review the new DTLS over SCTP proposal once drafts are available.
