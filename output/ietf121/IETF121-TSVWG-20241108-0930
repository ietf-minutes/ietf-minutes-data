## Summary

The TSVWG meeting focused on two main topics: configuring sockets for ECN over UDP and requirements for host to network collaboration signaling for per-packet metadata. The discussion on ECN configuration highlighted inconsistencies across operating systems and the need for better documentation. The discussion on host-to-network signaling sparked a debate about the value of per-packet metadata, security implications, and alternative approaches to congestion control.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Configuring Sockets for ECN over UDP:**
    *   Inconsistencies exist in how different operating systems (Linux, Apple, Microsoft, BSD) handle ECN-related socket options.
    *   Documentation for these options is often poor.
    *   The group discussed the potential for adopting the draft as an informational RFC.
    *   There's interest in cross-platform testing and CI to ensure the accuracy of the document over time.
    *   Mentioned the importance of including the contents of the control message which can differ between platforms.
*   **Requirements for Host to Network Collaboration Signaling:**
    *   The draft proposes using per-packet metadata to improve quality of service for unreliable flows.
    *   Concerns were raised about security implications, particularly exposing metadata that could reveal information about encrypted content.
    *   Discussion on the trade-offs between per-packet vs. per-flow signaling.
    *   The group discussed the potential for stateful vs. stateless schedulers.
    *   Some participants expressed skepticism about the general usefulness of the draft given privacy and security challenges.
    *   Alternative approaches such as focusing on building networks that don't lose packets were also highlighted.
    *   Considerations about the relationship between this work and scone as well as PANRG were also discussed.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **ECN Configuration Draft:**
    *   The working group will adopt the draft for informational purposes.
    *   Martin Duke will move the repository to the TSVWG GitHub.
    *   Contributors were asked to file issues and assist with documenting BSD platforms.
    *   The group agreed to confirm the adoption on the mailing list and solicit reviews.
*   **Host to Network Collaboration Signaling:**
    *   The chairs will talk to the AD about the value and direction of the work.
    *   Continue discussion on the mailing list to address concerns and refine the scope.
    *   Authors of draft to consider framing the discussion about real deployments and benefits.

## Next Steps

*   Confirm adoption of the ECN configuration draft on the mailing list and solicit reviews.
*   Continue the discussion on host to network collaboration signaling requirements on the mailing list, focusing on addressing security and privacy concerns and establishing demonstrable benefits.
*   Chairs will discuss the direction of the signaling work with the AD and report back to the working group.
