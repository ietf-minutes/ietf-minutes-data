## Summary
The BMWG meeting covered working group drafts, proposals, and discussed progress towards publication. Key topics included power benchmarking, multiple loss ratio measurement, container network benchmarking, segment routing benchmarking, calibrated time values, and source address validation. The meeting also included discussions on improving draft clarity, addressing reviewer feedback, and coordinating with other working groups.

## Key Discussion Points
*   **Power Benchmarking Draft:** Discussion on repeatability of tests, the definition of "idle plus" state, and aligning with the Green working group.

*   **Young Data Model Draft:** Discussion on the draft's purpose and its applicability for automating network tester management.
*   **Container Network Benchmarking Draft:** Discussion on categorizing EPP networking models and soliciting broader review from the working group.
*   **Segment Routing Benchmarking Draft:** Plans to present the draft in SPRING and SRV6OPS working groups to gather feedback, and a suggestion to consider SR policy testing.
*   **Calibrated Measured Time Values Draft:** Discussion on the need for calibration methodologies for time measurements in network elements, and the precision vs. accuracy of the measurements.
*   **Source Address Validation Draft:** A brief overview of this draft and its goals. The authors are seeking more feedback and comments.

## Decisions and Action Items
*   **Power Benchmarking Draft:** Continue discussions on the mailing list, particularly regarding the definition of the "idle plus" state and alignment with the Green working group.
*   **MLRS Draft:** Ready for progression after verification by the document shephard (Giuseppe) regarding IDNits fixes.
*   **Container Network Benchmarking Draft:** Solicit broader review from the working group to demonstrate support for moving to working group last call.
*   **Segment Routing Benchmarking Draft:** Gather feedback from SPRING and SRV6OPS working groups. Authors to consider SR policy testing based on feedback.
*   **All Drafts:** Participants are encouraged to review the drafts and provide feedback on the mailing list.

## Next Steps
*   Authors to address feedback received on drafts and prepare updated versions.
*   Chairs to ensure drafts presented to related working groups (SPRING, SRV6OPS).
*   Working group participants to review drafts and provide feedback on the mailing list.
*   Next meeting in Madrid.
