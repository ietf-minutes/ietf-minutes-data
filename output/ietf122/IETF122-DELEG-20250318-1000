# deleg

## Summary
The DNS delegation (deleg) working group meeting focused on choosing between two proposed protocols for improved DNS delegation: Draft Homburg (IDELIG) and Draft West Blap (DELIC). Presentations were given by the authors of each draft, followed by an extensive discussion of the pros and cons of each approach. The discussion covered topics such as incremental deployment, complexity, tooling, and potential for future extensibility. The group did not reach a decision but agreed to continue the discussion on the mailing list.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Incremental Deployment (Requirement H6):**
    *   Debate on whether H6 requires the ability to serve a single zone with a mix of DELIC-aware and unaware servers.
    *   Consensus that H6 primarily refers to avoiding a flag day requiring universal changes, enabling deployment at any level of the DNS tree, independent of the parent zone.
    *   Discussion on whether IDELIG provides more flexibility in incremental deployment.

*   **Technical Protocol Concerns:**
    *   Specific technical concerns regarding IDELIG involved the use of the underscore namespace.
    *   Concerns were raised about the complexity of implementing IDELIG due to the need for resolvers to understand and process the new type of delegation information.
    *   Clarification that West Blap DELIC draft is orthogonal independent of query minimization

*   **Complexity and Understandability:**
    *   IDELIG considered by some to be more complex due to the separate tree and extra changes to facilitate rollout, however others saw it as a clear path to incrementalism.
    *   Discussion on whether the introduction of the underscore label in IDELIG adds unnecessary complexity to the DNS.
    *   DELIC viewed by some as more straightforward, due to following existing DNS hierarchy however requires more changes to server software for deployment
*   **Tooling and Automation:**
    *   Debate on whether the choice between the two drafts will significantly impact tooling, since tooling is needed for zone file edits for either case.

*   **Implementation and Deployment:**
    *   Discussion of the effort needed for implementation of each option with some indicating that DELIC implementation may be easier.
    *   Suggestion to implement one draft to test and see issues and revisit it if there are issues.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Continue discussion on the mailing list:** The chairs will initiate discussion on the mailing list, revisiting the key questions and points raised during the meeting.

## Next Steps

*   The working group will use the mailing list to continue the discussion, focusing on the questions raised by the chairs.
*   The chairs will aim to achieve consensus on the choice of protocol draft for adoption based on the mailing list discussions.
