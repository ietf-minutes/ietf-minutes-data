# detnet

## Summary

The detnet working group meeting covered the status of existing documents, potential joint workshop with IEE 802.1Q, and several individual draft contributions focusing on queuing solutions, flow aggregation, scaling deterministic networks, and multi-domain connectivity. A key theme was the need to align new contributions with existing RFCs and terminology, especially in relation to single vs. multi-domain definitions.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Joint Workshop with IEE 802.1Q:** Discussion of a potential half-day workshop at the next IETF meeting to discuss how both groups continue the work of producing standards. A doodle poll will be sent to gauge participation.
*   **TSN Community Engagement:**  Need for better engagement with the TSN community to understand their needs and concerns regarding detnet. Suggestions included dedicated sessions for TSN-related questions and collaboration with industry representatives.
*   **Taxonomy Draft:**  Review of the data plane enhancement taxonomy draft. Authors of queuing solutions urged to map their solutions to the document's categories. An interim meeting is planned to review queuing solutions and their mapping to the taxonomy.
*   **Queuing Solutions:** Presentations and discussions on several queuing solutions, including C-score, EDF, and TQF. Feedback focused on alignment with the taxonomy draft and practical evaluation of performance.
*   **Flow Aggregation:** Presentation of a draft on flow aggregation for enhanced detnet. Feedback emphasized the need to define aggregation within a single domain and align with the existing Yang model for service definitions.
*   **Scaling Deterministic Networks:** Presentation of enhanced use cases for scaling deterministic networks. Discussion focused on the source of SLA requirements and the need for real-world implementation and validation.
*   **Multi-Domain Connectivity:**  Discussion of a draft on enabling multi-domain scenarios in wireless deterministic networks. Debate arose on the definition of "domain," whether based on technology, administrative control, or PCE scope. Next steps include creating a generic detnet multi-domain draft and exploring PCE-based control framework solutions.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Action Item:** Chairs to send out a doodle poll to both the detnet and IEE 802.1Q lists to assess interest and attendance for the potential joint workshop.
*   **Action Item:** Authors of queuing solutions to map their solutions to the categories defined in the taxonomy draft and provide feedback to the list.
*   **Action Item:** Schedule an interim meeting to review the different queuing solutions and where they fit within the taxonomy.
*   **Action Item:** Authors of the flow aggregation draft to define aggregation within a single domain and align with the existing Yang model.
*   **Action Item:** Carlos Bernardo to work on a more generic detnet multi-domain draft and potentially collaborate on a PC-based control framework document.

## Next Steps

*   Distribute doodle poll for workshop participation.
*   Schedule an interim meeting for queuing solutions review.
*   Continue discussions on the mailing list regarding the definition of "domain" and the scope of the multi-domain draft.
*   Progress individual draft contributions based on feedback received during the meeting.
