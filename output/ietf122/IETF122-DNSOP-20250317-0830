## Summary

The DNSOP meeting covered several important topics, including the status of existing drafts, new work proposals, hackathon projects, and presentations on CDS consistency, domain control validation using DNS, DNS filtering details for applications, and clarifications to the DNS ranking data draft. Discussions focused on improving clarity, addressing security concerns, and aligning with current practices.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Draft Status Updates:** Several drafts are progressing, including "Generalized Notify" (revising after IT last call) and "MUST NOT Gossip" (addressing SHA-1 issues). Warren's "Structure D.S. Error" is facing Datatracker issues.
*   **DNSSEC Automation:** Moving forward as informational due to limited feedback, but considered less controversial.
*   **NS3 Validation:** Working Group Last Call to be initiated.
*   **CDS Consistency:**  Draft is considered stable and ready for Working Group Last Call.  Switch is working on an implementation.
*   **Domain Control Validation (DCV):** Revamped draft (revision 07) focuses on text-based DCV records with random challenges. Discussions continued regarding inclusion of non-spaced DCV validation methods and distinguishing domain control validation from domain-based authorization. Concern raised about potential overlap between namespaces used for DCV and other parameters, such as blue sky handles.
*   **DNS Filtering Details for Applications:** Draft addresses the issue of censorship imposed via DNS and the lack of transparency for end users. Concerns were raised about potential misuse, browser security risks, and the complexity of presenting information to end users. A registry is used to mediate information being displayed to the user.
*   **DNS Ranking Data:**  Clarifications proposed for the DNS ranking data draft. The goal is to bring more clarity around the functions and responsibilities of DNS data. Proposed directives cover authoritative server behavior, name resolution results, non-authoritative responses, and the use of hints files for root zone servers.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **NS3 Validation:** Initiate Working Group Last Call.
*   **CDS Consistency:** Proceed to Working Group Last Call.
*   **DNS Integration:**  Initiate a call for adoption.
*   **DNSSEC Signing Pipeline:** Attendees were encouraged to review the slides from the interim meeting.
*   **Domain Control Validation (DCV):** Authors to update the draft based on discussions with Paul Hoffman and feedback from the working group, particularly regarding the scope and use cases of the document. Investigate the other draft from Swapnil Sheath.
*   **DNS Filtering Details for Applications:**  Continue discussion on the mailing list and consider coordination with the ICANN SAC work party.

## Next Steps

*   Authors of drafts to incorporate feedback from the meeting and mailing list.
*   Chairs to facilitate further discussion on the mailing list for contentious issues.
*   Coordinate review of documents with the DNS Directorate.
*   Advance drafts to Working Group Last Call where appropriate.
