## Summary

The DNSOP meeting covered several draft proposals, including collision-free key tags for DNSSEC, horizontal DNS synchronization (H-Sync), DNS Update with JSON (DUJ), Sig Zero updates, dry-run DNSSEC, and a proposal for registering the ".internal" TLD for private use. Discussions centered on the technical merits, operational implications, and potential adoption paths for each draft.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Collision-Free Key Tags for DNSSEC:** The draft aims to disallow colliding key tags for the same algorithms in the same zone to improve DNSSEC validation efficiency and mitigate denial-of-service attacks like KeyTrap.  Concerns were raised about adding complexity to the DNSSEC ecosystem and potentially preventing valid use cases.  The chairs will discuss with the AD how to go forward.
*   **Horizontal DNS Synchronization (H-Sync):** The proposal introduces an H-Sync record to facilitate communication and synchronization between multiple DNS providers, particularly in multi-signer scenarios.  It addresses challenges related to automation and consistency across providers.
*   **DNS Update with JSON (DUJ):**  The draft defines a JSON-based format for simplifying DNS record updates, especially for users copying and pasting configurations into web interfaces.  Concerns arose about potential confusion caused by double quotes in copy-pasted text.
*   **Sig Zero Updates:** The discussion focused on updating Sig Zero to include error fields and original ID fields for improved transaction authentication, particularly in forwarding scenarios.  Different options for handling the original ID and error return value were debated, including EDNS0 options, TTL reuse, and new RR type.
*   **Dry-Run DNSSEC:**  The draft proposes a mechanism for testing DNSSEC deployments in production environments without affecting real-world validation. It introduces a "dry-run" DS record and the possibility of reporting errors and successes. Interaction with aggressive caching was discussed.
*   **.internal TLD:** The discussion revolved around the proposed registration of the ".internal" TLD in the Special Use Domain Names (SUDDN) registry.  The string has already been selected and reserved by ICANN. Concerns were raised about IETF process and IANA involvement.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Collision-Free Key Tags for DNSSEC:** The chairs will discuss with the AD how to go forward.
*   **Horizontal DNS Synchronization (H-Sync):** The authors will follow up with an interim session on this topic with more details. The working group will discuss whether to handle the set of drafts individually or as a whole.
*   **DNS Update with JSON (DUJ):** The chair will discuss adoption status with the AD.
*   **Sig Zero Updates:** The author will update the draft based on feedback, especially regarding compatibility with existing implementations, and then seek working group adoption.
*   **Dry-Run DNSSEC:** The chair will discuss with the AD on next steps for adoption.
*   **.internal TLD:** Chairs will consider community feedback on Warren's proposal to include .internal in the SUDDN.

## Next Steps

*   Review the drafts discussed during the meeting and provide feedback to the authors.
*   The chairs will consult with the AD about the calls for adoption and the work group's load.
*   Monitor the mailing lists for further discussions and announcements regarding interim meetings.
