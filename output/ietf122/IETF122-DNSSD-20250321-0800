## Summary

The DNSSD working group session covered several key topics, including a review of changes made to the Update Lease and SRP drafts by the RFC editor, the status of the Multiple Q-Types draft, a presentation on Time Since Received (TSR) use cases and corner cases, updates on SRP replication and advertising proxy, and a discussion on using Service Bee with DNSD. The meeting focused on ensuring the working group's consensus on the technical accuracy of the documents and charting a path towards publication.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Update Lease and SRP Draft Changes:** A detailed review of changes made by the RFC editor to the Update Lease and SRP drafts, focusing on inconsistencies, missing details, and readability improvements. Specific changes included:
    *   Adding a "reasonable retry strategy" for lease renewals.
    *   Clarifying serial number handling in SRP.
    *   Improving the readability of RFC references.
    *   Adding symmetry to lease time limit descriptions.
    *   Revising security considerations related to flooding attacks, emphasizing the importance of avoiding rate limiting that could break existing clients.
*   **Multiple Q-Types:** Successful interoperability testing was reported from the recent hackathon. The draft is considered mature and ready for working group last call. An early allocation for the code was requested.
*   **Time Since Received (TSR):** Esco presented use cases and corner cases for the TSR option, including network topology changes and potential issues with advertising proxies missing announcements. The discussion clarified the proper use of TSR with SRP replication and the handling of the original registration timestamp. It was determined that the timestamp of the *original registration* is what is important to replicate.
*   **SRP Replication:** Progress has been blocked on TSR, which is now considered fairly mature. A version number mechanism was implemented to ensure interoperability between different SRP replication versions.
*   **Advertising Proxy:** A significant revision was made to the advertising proxy draft to make it less DNSSD-specific. Implementation and further testing are needed.
*   **Service Bee with DNSD:** A draft was presented on using SVCB and HTTPS resource records to enable services to advertise endpoint configuration properties, specifically ALPN support. The discussion covered query name construction, interaction with DADS/SRP, and the inclusion of SVCB records in responses.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Approval of Update Lease and SRP Drafts:** The working group approved the changes made to the Update Lease and SRP drafts. The chairs will approve the drafts to be published.
*   **Multiple Q-Types Last Call:** Proceed towards working group last call for the Multiple Q-Types draft.
*   **Early Allocation Request:** Chairs will ask the IANA to allocate code points for the Multiple Q-Types draft.
*   **TSR Co-Author:** Add ESCO as a co-author to the TSR draft.
*   **TSR Clarification:** Ensure the TSR document explicitly states that the original registration timestamp is replicated.
*   **Francois Report to Mailing List:** Francois will post a report to the mailing list detailing the hackathon testing of Multiple Q-Types and any issues found.

## Next Steps

*   Address any outstanding comments on the mailing list.
*   Plan for a Connect-a-thon or plugfest to test TSR and SRP replication.
*   Consider adding additional implementation advice to the TSR document.
*   Continue working on the advertising proxy draft.
*   Incorporate feedback into the Service Bee with DNSD draft, particularly regarding interactions with SRP and bundling SVCB records in responses.
