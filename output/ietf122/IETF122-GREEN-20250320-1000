## Summary

This session focused on discussing various data models for energy efficiency measurements and management. Presentations covered models for power and efficiency, energy measurements related to streaming, and energy management at device and network levels. The goal was to identify commonalities and determine a base model for the working group. Discussions revolved around the scope of the working group, the granularity of data collection, and the potential for a common architecture.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Philatelist and PowerF:** Discussion on the scope of Philatelist (a more generic framework) and its relationship to PowerF (focused on power measurements). The need to decouple the data model work from architectural decisions regarding Philatelist was emphasized.
*   **Streaming Energy Model:** Presentation of a data model for energy measurements in streaming devices, distinguishing between global system power and component-level power. Feedback focused on separating streaming-specific metrics from a more general base model.
*   **Energy Management Models:** A suite of models including a common energy module, a network inventory module, and a topology energy management module were presented. Focus was on the common module as a building block.
*   **Granularity and Scope:** Discussion on the level of granularity for data collection (component, device, network) and whether to include task-specific energy consumption.
*   **Use Cases:** The need to align the models with use cases and whether specific use cases require augmentations to a common base model was discussed.
*   **Terminology:** The need to align the models with the working group terminology document was mentioned.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Chairs to review Philatelist in more detail** to determine if it is in scope for the working group.
*   **Chairs to set up regular interim meetings** on a monthly cadence. These meetings will focus on specific topics, including use cases, terminology, and the base model.
*   **Encourage the working group to review the presented drafts** and provide comments on the mailing list.

## Next Steps

*   The chairs will propose a schedule for interim meetings, including potential topics.
*   Authors of similar drafts (Newman and Tony) will explore commonalities.
*   The working group will continue discussing the fundamental principles that should guide the development of a base model.
