## Summary
This meeting covered several BMP-related drafts, including TLV updates, extensions for non-standard elements, event-driven messages, RPKI filtering, and stats reporting. Discussions focused on simplifying TLV structures, time stamping requirements, code point allocation, addressing redundancy, and new message types. The working group discussed approaches to data synchronization, policy debugging, and monitoring within BMP.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **TLV Draft BMP version 4:**
    *   Stateless parsing TLV simplification by using BGP capabilities directly.
    *   Discussion of making time stamping mandatory and whether this is appropriate in this draft.
    *   IANA code point allocation requests for TLVs.
    *   Debate over whether to include AFI/SAFI and capability code in the TLV or just use the raw BGP capability.
*   **EBIT Draft:**
    *   Discussed merging the EBIT draft into the TLV draft.
    *   Open to alternative methods beyond EBIT for non-standard elements.
*   **Rail Draft:**
    *   Policy discard TLV was reworked based on feedback.
    *   Open question about REL's role and potential feedback loop use cases (e.g., flowspec).
    *   Discussion about whether REL should focus on errors or expand to cover a broader set of events.
*   **RIAB Filter Draft:**
    *   Consideration of working group adoption for BMP filtered.
*   **BMP RIP Stats Draft:**
    *   Discussion of initiating a working group last call for the BMP stats draft.
    *   Addressing stats that have not yet been implemented in production.
*   **BMP Collector Synchronization Draft:**
    *   Proposal to extend the peer header with a P-bit for BMP collector purging.
    *   Alternative approaches, such as a peer down notification with a TLV or a new message type, were suggested.
*   **Route Policy Modification Draft:**
    *   Proposal to use a C-bit in the peer header or a common update TLV to avoid sending duplicate unmodified messages in pre- and post-policy views.
    *   Discussion of the percentage of updates modified by inbound or outbound policies.
*   **BMP Local Peer Address Draft:**
    *   Discussion on potential updates to the ARAX peer address TLV.
    *   Consideration of using IPv6 mapped addresses for IPv4, replacing interface name/ID subtypes with zone IDs, and removing the address type field altogether.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **RIAB Filter Draft:** The minute taker to note a to-do item to do a working group call for adoption for BMP filtered.
*   **BMP RIP Stats Draft:**
    *   The minute taker to note a to-do item that working group last call will be issued for BMP stats.
    *   Confirm with the authors that they think they are at the point of being ready for last call.
*   **BMP Collector Synchronization and Route Policy Modification Drafts:** Multiple implementers should get together and converge on what is the most efficient way to get the task done and then circle back to the working group for working group adoption.

## Next Steps

*   Paolo to process feedback on the TLV, EBIT and Rail drafts.
*   Authors of drafts under discussion to consider the various suggestions made and potential integrations with other BMP drafts.
*   Working group to discuss and converge on a preferred method for handling synchronization.
*   Maxentiancy to process comments regarding the BMP Local Peer Address Draft.
