## Summary
This was the second grow session at IETF 122.  The session covered updates on several drafts, including BMP state summaries, BCP 194 revisions, source address validation deployment status, requirements for monitoring RPKI related processes on routers using BMP, and using BMP over quick connections. The chair initiated an adoption call for the terminology and routing drafts. There was a discussion on the feasibility of implementing BMP features on both the exporting and station sides. Also, the role of RFC editor was discussed.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **BMP State Summaries:**
    *   The draft has been retitled "BMP State Summaries" with a revised approach.
    *   The new approach introduces a state summary message as a collection of TLVs, including a mandatory summary ID TLV.
    *   Open questions include the need to signal the end of a summary and whether the initial sync could be changed to a summary.
    *   Concerns were raised about the cost of going over RIP content on the exporting side and potential need to make parts of the summary optional.
    *   Discussions suggested leveraging the end-of-rib mechanism for state summaries.

*   **BCP 194 Revisions:**
    *   The main document is waiting for two eternal drafts (EDs) to be adopted.
    *   A call for working group adoption of the EDs was initiated, with limited response.
    *   Suggestions to proceed with adoption if no objections are raised.
    *   Discussion regarding the status of BCP194 and the need to "kill it".

*   **Source Address Validation Deployment Status:**
    *   Draft presentation covering measurement methods and deployment status of source address validation.
    *   Observed about 67% of tested IPV4 ASNs and 72% of tested IPV6 ASNs lack any source address validation deployment.
    *   Manors network shows higher deployment ratio.

*   **Requirements for Monitoring RPKI Related Processes on Routers Using BMP:**
    *   Proposal of requirements for monitoring RPKI-related processes on routers using BMP.
    *   Discussion on the need to monitor the full life cycle of RPKI processes on routers.
    *   High-level requirements were raised for supporting RPKI in BMP.

*   **Using BMP over Quick Connections:**
    *   Update on the draft for using BMP over quick connections, including the addition of two new multi-stream usage modes.
    *   Discussions around stream allocation, multiplexing, and out-of-order messages.
    *   Concerns raised about appropriately mapping concepts for BMP.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Action Item:** Chair to send a reminder to the working group about the adoption call for the terminology and routing drafts.
*   **Decision:** Proceed with the BMP State Summary approach with its new message type.
*   **Action Item:** The BMP over Quick authors to continue collaboration on understanding how exactly B&P benefits from Quig.

## Next Steps

*   Determine if the revised BMP State Summary approach is a better way forward than the previous one, focusing on feasibility on the exporting side.
*   Address the question about how the approach interacts with the system for assigning BCP numbers.
*   Continue discussions on the mailing list for the RPKI monitoring draft.
