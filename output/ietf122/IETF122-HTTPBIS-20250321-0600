## Summary

This session covered several active drafts and proposals, including No Very Search, Incremental HTTP Messages, Unencoded Digests, Delete Cookie, HTTP-Only Cookie Prefix, the New Cookie Spec, and Client Hints Visibility. Key discussions revolved around adoption readiness, potential complexities, and the balance between performance, privacy, and implementation feasibility.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **No Very Search:**
    *   Ready for last call according to the presenter.
    *   Discussion on Google's multiple implementations vs. limited external deployments.
    *   Need for more client-side cache implementations.
    *   Consideration of marking the draft as updating RFC 9111.

*   **Incremental HTTP Messages:**
    *   Debate on the complexity of tri-state modes (incremental preferred, not preferred) versus a simple "hard fail" approach.
    *   Whether to include signal mechanism for intermediaries.
    *   Definition of "incremental" in terms of time and byte limits for buffering.

*   **Unencoded Digests:**
    *   Proposal for adoption and publication.
    *   Question on whether another digest header would add confusion.
    *   Use case tied to Signature-based SRI work.

*   **Delete Cookie and HTTP-Only Cookie Prefix:**
    *   Adoption requests for both drafts.
    *   Discussion on folding them into the larger, in-progress cookie specification revision.
    *   Interest in how these changes touch components like partition cookies and third-party cookie blocking.

*   **New Cookie Spec:**
    *   Proposal for adoption.
    *   Integration with Fetch and the Cookie Store API.
    *   Need for advice from the group regarding server objectives, particularly around cookie deletion.

*   **Client Hints Visibility:**
    *   Should the problem be addressed?
    *   Does implementation using Aliphites and Access Frame justify adopting as a draft?
    *   Discussion of TLS draft adoption as prerequisite.
    *   Concern about adaptive content, the responsibility for adaptation, and associated privacy implications.
    *   Doubts on a frame signalling this.
    *   Concrete use cases that unlock benefit the user and benefit the client need to be clear

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **No Very Search:**
    *   File an issue for formally marking the draft as updating RFC 9111 and discuss more with Mark.
    *   Continue working in group last call, while parking for a short time
*   **Delete Cookie and HTTP-Only Cookie Prefix:**
    *   Run an adoption call on each individual draft
*   **New Cookie Spec:**
    *   Chairs (Tommy and Mark) to initiate the adoption process.

## Next Steps

*   **All:** Review discussed drafts and provide feedback on the mailing lists.
*   **Client Hints Visibility:** Share the use cases with the group and updates from any conversations with W3C.
