# iabopen

## Summary

The IAB Open meeting covered several key topics, including updates on IAB technical programs (E-Impact, EDM), a review of the recent NEMOPS workshop, updates on IAB liaison RFCs, and a report on the IETF's liaison relationship with the W3C. Discussions highlighted the need for better operator engagement, improved tooling for network management, and clearer communication regarding liaison relationships.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **E-Impact Program:** The E-Impact design team has released a zero-zero draft and is seeking feedback, particularly at the Sustainability Proposed Research Group. The group aims to define its end goals.
*   **EDM Program:** The EDM program on evolvability, deployability, and maintainability is planning renewed activity in the coming months. New program leads Jana and Warren were welcomed.
*   **NEMOPS Workshop:** The workshop revisited network management after 22 years, emphasizing the need to engage more with the operator community. Key findings included the continued prevalence of CLI and SNMP, despite advancements in Netconf and YANG; and the importance of ease of use in network management tools. Participants discussed challenges in transitioning to YANG, model divergence, and the need for interoperability testing.
*   **IAB Liaison RFC Updates:** The IAB is updating RFCs 4052 and 4053, which define the liaison process. The updates aim to clarify when to send liaison statements, when to establish formal relationships, and remove outdated information on tooling.
*   **W3C Liaison:** The IETF is trialing a cross-area review team with the W3C to leverage expertise in areas such as internationalization. W3C has provided valuable reviews on IETF last calls.  Clarification is needed on the origin of W3C reviews during IETF last calls.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **E-Impact:** Solicit feedback on the zero-zero draft at the Sustainability Proposed Research Group.
*   **IAB Liaison RFCs:** Community to review and provide feedback on the updated liaison RFC drafts on the architecture discuss list.
*   **W3C Liaison:** The IAB needs to figure out some kind of pre-amble to add to W3C review emails to make things clearer.

## Next Steps

*   Continue discussions on NEMOPS workshop findings within the NMOPs working group and the Ops area.
*   Advance the updated IAB Liaison RFCs (4052 and 4053) towards IAB adoption and IETF last call.
*   Monitor and evaluate the ongoing trial of the cross-area review team with the W3C.
*   IAB will dive into the WISIS plus 20 process at the next meeting.
