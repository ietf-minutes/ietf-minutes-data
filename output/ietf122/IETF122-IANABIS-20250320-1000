## Summary

The inaugural meeting of the IANABIS working group focused on reviewing the charter, discussing the scope of work for updating BCP 26 (RFC 8126), and determining next steps. A key discussion point revolved around the role of IANA in registry management and the authority of designated experts. The group agreed to proceed with multiple documents under the BCP 26 umbrella, including a potential update to RFC 7120 for early allocation procedures. The group agreed to adopt the IANA documents as starting points for the working group.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Charter Review:** Clarification needed on whether the charter allows for multiple documents as output, despite wording suggesting only one. Consensus reached to proceed with multiple documents under BCP 26.
*   **Scope of Work:** Discussion about the extent of IANA's role in registry management (organizational vs. clerical).
*   **Designated Expert Authority:** Concerns raised about designated experts potentially overriding IETF consensus, particularly when registering entries from IETF consensus documents.  Need for clarification on the expert's role in registry organization versus evaluating new registrations.
*   **Early Allocation:** Discussions and questions around the term of early allocations and the lack of an upper limit on renewals. Proposal to extend the initial term of early allocation from one to two years.
*   **Definition of "Specification Required":**  Discussion on what constitutes a valid specification, including the use of Internet-Drafts, accessibly of specifications that require payment, and potential levels of "specification required."
*   **Maintenance of Registrations:** Adding the maintenance of registrations where the original registrants have disappeared to the scope of work.
*   **IANA Section Content:** Suggestions to be more prescriptive, and supply more boilerplate for authors to better meet the IANA requirements.
*   **IANA Best Practices and Suggestions:** Adding a section for best practices for registry design, including the addition of change controller fields for certain registration procedures.
*   **Early Registry Creation:** Demand for a new document that would allow for early registry creation in working groups that have multiple documents that need registry allocations from it.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Decision:** The working group will proceed with multiple documents under the BCP 26 umbrella.
*   **Decision:** The working group will adopt the IANA documents as starting points.
*   **Action Item:** Chairs (Marie Kutrawi and Ted Hardy) to work with AD Roman to explore a quick re-chartering if needed for RFC 7120 bis.
*   **Action Item:** Chairs to schedule interim virtual meetings between now and the Madrid meeting, taking into account availability constraints.
*   **Action Item:** Collect date ranges from interested parties who will be unavailable for potential interim meetings.
*   **Action Item:** The working group will use the mailing list to confirm the in-room adoption call for IANA document and solicit additional feedback and opinions.
*   **Action Item:** Marie and Ted to work offline with Roman to determine the timing of the charter adjustment.

## Next Steps

*   Poll and confirmation of the intent to adopt the IANA drafts on the mailing list
*   Schedule interim virtual meetings.
*   Begin working on updating RFC 8126 (BCP 26) using the IANA documents as a starting point.
*   Explore a potential re-chartering to explicitly include RFC 7120 bis within the scope of work.
