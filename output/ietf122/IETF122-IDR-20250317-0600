## Summary

The IDR meeting covered a range of topics including BGP Tunnel Encapsulation Attribute updates, link bandwidth extended community, BGP SR policy, flow spec, the SCPath attribute, and V6/V4 islands over a V6 core.  Discussions focused on draft status, adoption requests, pre-Shepherd reviews, implementation considerations, and security implications.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **BGP Tunnel Encapsulation Attribute:**  A template for authors adding new tunnels or sub-TLVs was discussed.  The importance of including information such as the tunnel name, description, mandatory/optional sub-TLVs, validation procedures, interaction between tunnel TLVs, security considerations, and management details was emphasized.
*   **Link Bandwidth Extended Community:**  Updates on the draft were presented, focusing on error handling, particularly in the context of multiple link bandwidth extended communities. The discussion clarified that error handling applies during weighted ECMP computation, preferring the lowest value irrespective of transitivity unless values are the same. Questions were raised regarding the propagation of non-transitive communities and the relationship between this draft and the best-current-practice draft. Community scrubbing was emphasized.
*   **BGP SR Policy:** An extension to BGP SR policy for puzzle scheduling was introduced, particularly addressing scenarios with discontinuous links and frequent topology changes. Discussion centered around the potential use of the management plane vs. control plane for this feature, coordination with the TVR and SPRING working groups, and the use of scheduled LSPs.
*   **Flow Spec:** Discussion centered on several drafts related to flow spec V2.  Key points included the order of filters, a default implementation and design, how to address sparse component sets, and the minimal implementation of V2, action extended communities, and conflict resolution.
*   **FCBGP:** The forwarding commitment draft was presented, focusing on securing BGP announcements.  Discussion covered the security guarantees provided by FCBGP, particularly in partial deployment scenarios, and compared it to BGPSEC. Considerations included the risk of state removal, copy-and-paste attacks, and the potential for leveraging RPKI.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Link Bandwidth Extended Community:** Authors will incorporate suggestions from the mailing list to better discuss filtering and potential impacts when implemented without community support.
*   **BGP SR Policy:** Authors to send a formal adoption request to the IDR mailing list. Authors will revise their draft in accordance with a shepherd review. Authors to coordinate bit definitions with SPRING working group.
*   **Flow Spec:** Authors to consider feedback about the best approach to deal with filter TLVs components and numbering conventions.
*   **FCBGP:** Authors to consider the suggestion to include static RPKI information. The topic will be discussed further on the mailing list and at the upcoming cider ops meeting.

## Next Steps

*   Working group last call on the BGP SR policy NRPO3 draft will proceed, likely alongside its LS feature.
*   Further discussion and collaboration with SPRING, TVR, and other relevant working groups on topics such as BGP SR Policy and administrative flags will occur.
*   Continue discussion on the mailing list and at future meetings regarding FCBGP and other topics presented.
