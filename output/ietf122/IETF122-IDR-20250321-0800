## Summary

The IDR working group meeting covered several draft proposals, including extensions to BGP FlowSpec for CAS traffic steering, a solution for connecting IPv4 islands over IPv6 (4PE), dynamic capability advertisement in BGP, and SRv6 list optimization. The discussions highlighted the need for coordination with other working groups, addressing potential interoperability issues, and clarifying the scope and applicability of the proposed solutions.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **BGP FlowSpec V2 for CAS:**
    *   The draft proposes extensions to BGP FlowSpec to enable flow classification and path selection for CAS.
    *   Concerns were raised about security error handling and the need to coordinate with the CATS working group.
    *   Coordination with ongoing work on FlowSpec V2 regarding match criteria and action types is crucial.
*   **4PE:**
    *   The draft describes a solution for connecting IPv4 islands over an IPv6 core.
    *   It's an informational draft leveraging existing standards (RFC 4798, RFC 5549, RFC 8950).
    *   Questions arose about the necessity of 4PE in scenarios where IPv4-less AS configurations are possible, to be addressed on the mailing list.
*   **BGP Dynamic Capability:**
    *   The draft aims to enable dynamic advertisement of BGP capabilities without session resets.
    *   Challenges exist in handling capabilities requiring tight coordination between peers (Type C).
    *   Concerns about backward compatibility with existing deployments of BGP dynamic capability version 16. Making the ACK mandatory poses interoperability issues. Deployment experience needs to be collected and backward compatibility needs to be considered.
*   **SRv6 List Optimization:**
    *   The draft proposes optimizations for SRv6 policies by enabling controllers to notify ingress nodes about the presence of egress node SIDs in the SID list.
    *   Concerns raised on dependency on administrative flag TLV which is not a working group document.
    *   Coordination is required with other working groups. Common TLV usage is requested for the Admin TLV.
    *   Incomplete support in the network needs text describing the behavior in this scenario.
*   **BGPLS Advertisement of QOS Parameters**
    *   The draft proposes extensions to report QOS (CIR, PIR) information.
    *   Consider dynamic queues as they are supported with NPO
    *   The proposal is only over BGPLS, is there consideration for IGP?

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **BGP FlowSpec V2 for CAS:**
    *   Authors to revise the draft based on feedback regarding security error handling.
    *   Authors to coordinate with CATS working group and FlowSpec V2 development.
*   **4PE:**
    *   Author to provide text and respond on the mailing list for the question on why IPv4 is needed when you can run without it.
*   **BGP Dynamic Capability:**
    *   Authors to collect and review implementation reports, especially regarding the impact of making the ACK mandatory.
    *   Address the question on backwards compatibility between existing and new implementers.
    *   Consider merging extended dynamic capability into the current draft.
*   **SRv6 List Optimization:**
    *   Authors to work together with Spring regarding draft and protocols.
    *   Address dependency on administrative flag TLV.
    *   Add a section describing behaviour when not fully supported.
    *   Consider common TLV usages.

## Next Steps

*   Authors to revise drafts based on discussions and feedback.
*   Continue discussions on the mailing lists.
*   Evaluate adoption of the 4PE and SRv6 List Optimization drafts after addressing comments and action items.
