## Summary
This meeting covered several topics including a CAA Security Tag proposal, content types for private key information, and a discovery extension for X.509 certificates. The CAA Security Tag proposal sparked a detailed discussion regarding its potential benefits and how it could improve security. Assignment of content types was straightforward. The discovery extension raised interesting points regarding its purpose, security implications, and potential for future enhancements.

## Key Discussion Points
*   **CAA Security Tag:**
    *   Henry Burgly presented a draft defining a new CAA tag named "security" to enhance domain control validation against network attackers.
    *   The tag is designed to enforce specific security requirements before a CA issues a certificate.
    *   Discussion involved the advantages of a declarative security approach versus existing methods, addressing the complexities of validating domain ownership across different CAs and DNS setups.
    *   Concerns were raised about potential deployment issues and the need for CAs to validate DNSSEC.
*   **PKCS#8 Content Types:**
    *   Joe Madow presented a straightforward draft assigning content types for single private key info and encrypted private key info.
    *   This addresses the need for CMS content types to wrap existing PKCS#8 formatted keys.
*   **Discovery Extension:**
    *   The session discussed an X.509 extension to facilitate the discovery of related certificates.
    *   Use cases included linking signing and encryption certificates, bridging between different cryptographic algorithms (e.g., RSA and post-quantum), and certificate renewal.
    *   Questions arose regarding the intended consumers, the applicability to WebPKI, and potential security concerns with relying solely on URIs for discovery.
    *   There was also a discussion about adding a "purpose" field to the extension to specify the intended relationship between certificates.

## Decisions and Action Items
*   **CAA Security Tag:** Henry Burgly will start a thread on the mailing list to solicit updates and recommendations before a call for adoption.
*   **PKCS#8 Content Types:** No objections were raised and it was decided to move forward with a call for adoption.
*   **Discovery Extension:** Despite some reservations, a call for adoption will be issued. Post-adoption bike shedding and discussion will commence regarding extension purposes and potential improvements to the ASN.1.

## Next Steps
*   Henry Burgly to start mailing list thread for the CAA security tag draft.
*   Issue calls for adoption for the PKCS#8 content types and Discovery Extension drafts.
*   Discuss design options for the discovery extension on the mailing list, particularly regarding the addition of a "purpose" field.
