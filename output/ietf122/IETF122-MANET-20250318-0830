## Summary
The MANET working group meeting covered draft statuses, presentations on AODV version 2 and MANET internetworking, and discussions on the proposed new charter text. Key discussion points included the management of D-Lab settings, the applicability of the proposed charter additions, and the future direction of MANET internetworking research.

## Key Discussion Points
*   **D-Lab extension cluster draft:** Progress being made, discussions ongoing. Lou requested to provide approvals.
*   **AODV version 2:** Presentation by Charlie Perkins on the NS3 model implementation. Discussion on performance characteristics (packet sizes, route requests/replies) and the potential for working group adoption.
*   **MANET Internetworking:** Fred Templin presented on Omnilink Overlay for global IPV6 addressing in MANETs, enabling internetworking and transit between MANETs.  Discussion centered on addressing schemes, integration with existing networks (OSPF, BGP), and the applicability to different MANET scenarios.
*   **Charter Text:** Discussion on proposed additions to the charter text regarding management of D-Lab settings and making router state available. Concerns raised about the necessity and scope of these additions, particularly regarding the management of information learned from modems and radios.

## Decisions and Action Items
*   **D-Lab extension cluster draft:** Lou to provide approvals on flow control and traffic classification drafts for submission to IESG.
*   **Charter Text:**
    *   Chairs to consult with INTADs regarding the proposed additions related to address auto-configuration.
    *   Evaluate and potentially refine the charter text based on feedback on the mailing list.
*   **AODV Version 2:** Attendees to provide feedback on its value, and if there is enthusiasm to move forward with adoption as a working group item, on the mailing list.

## Next Steps
*   Address outstanding comments and reviews on existing D-Lap related drafts.
*   Christopher Dayloff's individual draft needs review.
*   Further discussion on the MANET internetworking drafts and their potential inclusion as working group items.
*   The group will take the charter text back to the mailing list for further discussion and refinement.
