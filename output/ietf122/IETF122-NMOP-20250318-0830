## Summary

The NMOP working group meeting covered several topics including hackathon results on Yang Push Publisher implementations, C-map for SRV6 and topology linking to external data, anomaly detection integration updates, and the transformation of Yang configuration instance data to knowledge graphs. A presentation was given on HTTPS notifications using Kafka and bandwidth analysis.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Yang Push Publisher Hackathon Results (Thomas):**
    *   Focus on notification envelope and system notification capability discovery.
    *   Testing extended to broadband access (OLT).
    *   Website created for implementers with test results and configurations.
    *   First CBO named identifier implementation tested successfully.
    *   Lack of DTLS/TLS implementations.
*   **C-map for SRV6 and Linking Topology to External Data (Sheriff):**
    *   Modeling of multi-layer networks using C-map.
    *   Linking external data (configuration, metrics) to the C-map model using templates.
    *   Two approaches for augmenting the C-map: direct augmentation (approach one) and an intermediate layer (approach two).
    *   Pros and cons of each approach discussed regarding scalability and complexity.
    *   Added SRV6 on top of ISIS to the C-map model.
*   **Anomaly Detection Integration Update (Vincenzo):**
    *   Updates on the Network Anomaly Lifecycle document and Semantic Metadata Annotation draft.
    *   Focused on young format and fixing key errors.
    *   Addition of a global concern score at the relevant state level.
    *   Added URI to link anomaly visualization to the anomaly object.
    *   Antagonist (open-source label store) being used to validate drafts.
*   **Yang Configuration Instance Data to Knowledge Graph (Michael):**
    *   Experiment with transforming Yang instance data into RDF (Resource Description Framework) using RML (RDF Mapping Language).
    *   Using Sparkle to query the RDF data.
    *   Conclusion that this was not a good problem approach due to scalability issues.
    *   Poor tooling in the RDF and property graph worlds.
    *   Suggesting the use of streaming approaches with XML tools instead.
*   **HTTPS Notifications and Bandwidth Analysis (Students):**
    *   Implemented HTTPs notifications using Kafka and performed bandwidth analysis of different encoding formats (CBO, XML, JSON).
    *   CBO performed better at lower bandwidths.
    *   Proposed draft to extend the existing HTTPs notifications draft to support CBO encoding.
    *   Lack of tooling for CBO in Yang libraries was an issue.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Adrian:** To make minor edits to the terminology draft and continue detailed survey of terminology usage in existing NMOP drafts.
*   **Sheriff:** Engage with the NMOP working group to get feedback on approach one vs. approach two for linking external data to C-map, with the goal of proceeding with one approach.
*   **Michael:** To address scalability issues related to RDF graph generation for IETF 123 Hackathon in Madrid.
*   **Lionel/Nacho/Michael:** Explore possible joint discussion on Airmen deployment
*   **Michael:** Share experiences and feedback on using RML for YANG instance data
*   **Students:** (NITK Students) To continue work on their implementation, and explore contributing to open source Cibor and Gansson libraries to add Cibor support.

## Next Steps

*   Continue hackathon activities to validate and refine the drafts.
*   Evaluate and address feedback on the proposed approaches.
*   Further discussion on knowledge graph approaches.
*   Continue development of running code to accelerate specifications.
