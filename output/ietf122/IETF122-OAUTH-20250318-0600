## Summary
The OAuth working group meeting covered several key topics, including the Token Status List, Attestation-Based Client Authentication, OAuth 2.1, OAuth for First-Party Apps, Client ID Scheme, and updates to the Security BCP. The discussion focused on recent changes, outstanding issues, and potential future directions for each topic.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Token Status List:**
    *   Discussion on incorporating X.509 certificates into the status list. Decision was made this is out of scope for the OAuth working group.
    *   Consideration of registering a content format for the plus CD media type.
    *   Agreement to initiate a second working group last call for the document after incorporating size comparison data.
*   **Attestation-Based Client Authentication:**
    *   Discussion on the use of HTTP OPTIONS for retrieving nonces and potential conflicts with CORS pre-flight checks.
    *   Feedback on the need for explicit Nonce reaching
    *   Concerns about the complexity of the metadata endpoint listing mechanism for discovering when to use nonces.
    *   Request for reviewers - Peter, Tim and Monty volunteered.
*   **OAuth 2.1:**
    *   Agreement to remove strict binding of OAuth 2.1 to HTTP, allowing for non-HTTP transports.
    *   Targeting a working group last call before the next IETF meeting.
*   **OAuth for First-Party Apps:**
    *   Discussion on whether the draft should be an extension of Pushed Authorization Requests (PAR).
    *   Opinions varied, with some arguing for a cleaner layering and potential for driving PAR adoption, while others expressed concerns about conflating different flows and increased complexity.
*   **Client ID Scheme:**
    *   Presentation of a mechanism for client ID schemes to handle URLs as client identifiers.
    *   Discussion of potential conflicts with existing uses and the need for alignment with the OpenID for Verifiable Presentations (VP) specification.
*   **Security BCP Update:**
    *   Brief overview of the audience injection attack and a mix-up variant.
    *   Discussion on the process for updating the BCP, with a consensus towards publishing small, focused documents on specific issues rather than a complete rewrite.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Token Status List:** Start a second work group last call.
*   **Attestation-Based Client Authentication:** Continue discussion on the mailing list, focusing on Nonce retrieval.
*   **OAuth for First-Party Apps:** More feedback is needed - move the discussion to the mailing list.
*   **Security BCP Update:** Create a small, focused document about the discovered attacks.

## Next Steps

*   **Token Status List:** Authors to update the document with size comparisons.
*   **Attestation-Based Client Authentication:** Authors to consider feedback on Nonce mechanism, implement changes, and send to reviewers for feedback.
*   **OAuth 2.1:** Editor to incorporate feedback and prepare for working group last call.
*   **OAuth for First-Party Apps:** Encourage more feedback on the mailing list.
*   **Client ID Scheme:** Await the outcome of discussions in the OpenID for VP working group before finalizing the draft.
*   **Security BCP Update:** Authors to begin working on a new document detailing the recently discovered attacks.
