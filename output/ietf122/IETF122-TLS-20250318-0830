# TLS

## Summary
This TLS meeting covered several important topics, including the status of existing drafts, the FAT process, and potential adoption of new PQ algorithms.  Key discussions revolved around the SSL Keylog draft, the 8773-bis draft relating to PSKs and quantum resilience, and a proposed TLS flag for requesting client certificates in specific scenarios.  Decisions were made regarding the SSL Keylog draft, while the 8773-bis draft and the mtLS flag proposal require further consideration.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **SSL Keylog Draft:**  A revived discussion surrounding the adoption of the combined SSL Keylog draft resulted in concerns being raised about extensibility and potential security implications. Some felt the working group hadn't adequately addressed previous concerns on the mailing list.
*   **8773-bis (PSK and Quantum Resilience):** A detailed presentation of the FAT report for the 8773-bis draft, which explores the use of PSKs in TLS to achieve quantum resilience.  The FAT reviewers found that while the draft did not introduce vulnerabilities to traditional TLS, the claims about quantum resilience were not well substantiated, especially considering PSK reuse and group use scenarios.
*   **mtLS Flag:** A proposal for a new TLS flag to signal that a client is configured with a certificate and willing to provide it upon request. The main use case discussed was to allow servers to differentiate between bots and human users.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **SSL Keylog Draft:** The working group decided *not* to progress with the publication of the SSL Keylog draft in its current form.
*   **8773-bis (PSK and Quantum Resilience):** Further discussion is required in the working group. Options include publishing the document as is, revising the security claims, or waiting for a formal analysis.
*   **mtLS Flag:** Further discussion is required on the mailing list to refine the definition and applicability of the proposed TLS flag.

## Next Steps

*   Chairs to analyze the results of the in-session voting on the 8773-bis draft and determine the next course of action.
*   Continue discussion on the mtLS flag proposal on the mailing list to address concerns about its applicability and potential for misuse.
*   Continue to process the existing queue of documents being reviewed by the FAT.
*   The next TLS meeting will be held on Thursday at 9:30 AM.
