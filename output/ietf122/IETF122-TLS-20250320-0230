## Summary

This TLS working group meeting covered a range of topics, including trust anchors, password-authenticated key exchange (PAKE), encrypted client hello (ECH), and attested TLS. Discussions centered on improving security, addressing deployment challenges, and exploring new approaches to authentication and encryption. Several proposals were presented, generating lively debate and calls for further investigation.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Trust Anchors (David Benjamin):**
    *   Discussion of Trust Anchor Identifier sizes and the best way to transmit the data within TLS.
    *   Consideration of in-band vs. out-of-band trust anchor metadata provisioning.
    *   Exploration of the DNS dependency in the proposed trust anchor solution and potential alternatives.
    *   Debate on the complexity and trade-offs of the retry flow.
    *   Consideration of using OIDs vs. other ID schemes for identifying trust anchors.
*   **PAKE (Laura Bauman):**
    *   Presentation of a TLS 1.3 PAKE extension draft for low-entropy secrets.
    *   Discussion of integrating PAKE with existing TLS key exchange mechanisms for post-quantum resistance.
    *   Consideration of adding certificate support to the PAKE extension.
    *   Debate on whether to pursue a general PAKE framework or a targeted solution with a specific PAKE algorithm.
    *   Addressing security concerns related to key leakage and impersonation.
    *   Questions around interest and a bar for adoption after previous attempts to define PAKEs for TLS.
*   **Post-Handshake PAKE (Yang Xia):**
    *   Presentation of a proposal for post-handshake PAKE negotiation.
    *   Discussion of the benefits of post-handshake PAKE, including defense in depth and channel binding.
    *   Concerns raised about the proposal's lack of integration with TLS and potential overlap with existing protocols.
*   **ECH (Nick Sullivan, Martin Thomson, Christopher Wood):**
    *   Discussion of the limitations of current ECH deployments.
    *   Problems with the outer SNI field of the encrypted client hello making it easier to block.
    *   Exploration of potential solutions for improving ECH anonymity, including disabling shared caching and using per-connection public names.
    *   Debate on the role of public names and anonymity sets in ECH.
    *   Reviewing a different approach on a new way to have all servers re-randomize how public names get transmitted.
*   **Attested TLS (Osama):**
    *   Presentation of a formal analysis of the Attested TLS draft, highlighting a vulnerability that breaks server authentication.
    *   Discussion of solutions for augmenting rather than replacing server authentication, binding it to the remote attestation identity.
    *   Discussion of potential solutions involving certificate verify messages and channel binders.
    *   Concerns raised about the threat model and the difficulty of ensuring trust in the presence of compromised virtual machines.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Trust Anchors:** The discussion will continue on the mailing list to further refine the design and address the identified decision points. The group will need to work towards consensus on key issues such as the DNS dependency and the retry flow.
*   **PAKE:** The chairs will initiate an adoption call on the mailing list for the first PAKE proposal focusing on low-entropy secrets.
*   **ECH:** Further work is needed to address the privacy and deployment challenges associated with ECH. The working group will continue to explore potential solutions, and any efforts will continue after ECH reaches RFC status.

## Next Steps

*   Adoption call for the first PAKE proposal on the mailing list.
*   Continued discussion on the mailing lists regarding trust anchors, ECH, and Attested TLS.
*   Further development and refinement of the proposed solutions based on the feedback received during the meeting.
