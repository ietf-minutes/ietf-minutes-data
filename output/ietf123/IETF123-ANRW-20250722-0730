## Summary

The Applied Networking Research Workshop (ANRW) 2025 meeting covered a range of topics including network misconfiguration, carbon-aware content delivery, and 360 video streaming. Laurent Van Bever delivered a keynote on tackling network misconfiguration using verification techniques. Presentations followed on carbon-intelligent content scheduling in CDNs and end-to-end 360 video streaming over HTTP/3.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Network Misconfiguration (Laurent Van Bever):**
    *   Configuring networks is challenging due to a semantic gap between high-level operator requirements and low-level configurations.
    *   Network verification promises to improve network reliability by formally proving configuration compliance.
    *   Current verifiers often check a restricted set of properties (primarily forwarding-level properties) and are imprecise.
    *   Verifiers need to be sound (report all bugs) and complete (report only bugs).
    *   Discussion on model-based vs. model-less approaches for network management.
    *   Question from Sergey regarding verification roles related to cascading failures and electrical power grids.
    *   Question from Rudiger on high-level abstraction of specification languages.
    *   Question from Matthew on collaboration with ISPs.
    *   Question from Debo on LEO satellites and AI.
    *   Question on Ops Area's interaction to help network operators and academics.

*   **Carbon-Intelligent Content Scheduling in CDNs (Sassan Ele Zahar):**
    *   Exploration of carbon-aware scheduling of content fill in CDNs to reduce carbon emissions.
    *   Multi-hop transmission between caches offers further carbon savings.
    *   Demonstrated 13-17% carbon savings with single-hop and 53-64% with multi-hop scheduling on Netflix data.
    *   Savings higher in Europe due to greater green energy adoption.
    *   Scheduling window of three days ahead provides significant savings.
    *   Question from John regarding how traffic switching results in savings.
    *   Questions about the significance of transfer and relating carbon/energy to different aspects.

*   **End-to-End 360 Video Streaming over HTTP/3 (Felipe Ribeiro Rosa):**
    *   Presentation on an architecture for end-to-end 360 video streaming using HTTP/3.
    *   Discussion of adaptive bitrate selection and tile-based delivery to optimize video quality.
    *   Multi-path QUIC and SAECF (prioritized streams) are employed to improve quality of service.
    *   Experiement with blocking/non-blocking tiles.
    *   Stalls remain a big problem.
    *   Question from Here about stream setup.
    *   Question from Sergey about network issues and limitations for 3D streaming.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Action Item:** Follow-up between Debo and Laurent regarding LLM applications and AI integration.
*   **Action Item:** Suggested follow up with NMOP and INI regarding future jobs.
*   **Action Item:** Laurent and his team to visit OPS area for discussing future work.
*   **Decision:** The meeting will have a break of 30 minutes and will reconvene at 1130.

## Next Steps

*   Continue research on increasing properties, improve coverage, improve usability.
*   Further research on traffic scheduling and improvement for performance for 360 streaming.
