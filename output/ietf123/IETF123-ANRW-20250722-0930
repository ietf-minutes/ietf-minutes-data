## Summary

The anrw session featured six presentations covering diverse topics: affiliations within SDOs like IETF, utilizing LLMs for IETF collaboration, automated network protocol testing with LLMs, emulation of satellite constellations, website loading emulation, and network tomography using explicit flow measurements (EFM). Discussions focused on the implications of each study, potential improvements, and future research directions.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **IETF Affiliations (Ignacio Castro):**
    *   The number of organizations participating in the IETF has remained stable while individual participation has decreased.
    *   Engagement varies significantly by type (meetings, mailing lists, drafts, RFCs).
    *   Conversion rate from draft to RFC is decreasing.
    *   Inequality in organizational participation is roughly stable.
    *   Discussion around the cyclical nature of work within the IETF (problem-solving phases).
    *   There was a discussion if the presenters work identified differences among the IETF areas.
*   **LLM-Enhanced IETF Collaboration (Jib Bian):**
    *   A data set called Cautex Flow links working group discussions to internet draft changes.
    *   A search system uses information retrieval (sparse and dense retrieval) to connect comments to specific drafts.
    *   An edit task instructs LLMs to produce internet drafts based on previous versions and comments.
    *   Discussion about distinguishing the approach from direct LLM paper writing; the work focuses on accelerating the editing phase.
    *   Concerns were raised about LLM hallucinations and how to validate results.
*   **Automated Network Protocol Testing with LLMs (Junze Way):**
    *   The study addresses the widening gap between protocol testing demands and the capabilities of current methods.
    *   The framework (NetTAS AIM) extracts structured specifications from RFCs to generate test cases and code.
    *   A validation process is used to check the generated test cases.
    *   Coverage of 95.1% was reported for evaluated RFCs.
    *   Discussion about the definition of coverage.
    *   Discussion regarding comparison with human written tests.
*   **Phantom Link: Emulating Virtual End-to-End Links (Juan Sosa):**
    *   Phantom Link is an emulation tool for satellite constellations, focusing on space-to-space and space-to-ground links.
    *   The tool addresses the challenge of rapidly changing and multi-path conditions in LEO constellations.
    *   It abstracts physical path characteristics into end-to-end propagation and bottleneck data rate.
    *   Evaluation using IPERF with Starlink topology parameters was presented, and Reno, Cubic, and BBR were compared.
    *   Discussions explored differences compared to existing simulators and the consideration of packet loss.
*   **Browse: Model-Based Website Loading Emulation (Kilian Holzinger):**
    *   Browseum is an emulator for reproducible website loading activity, replacing browser dependencies with requests and network path emulation.
    *   It simplifies setup and allows for modifying protocol implementations.
    *   The approach involves scraping websites, building models, and emulating the loading process.
    *   Discussions focused on prioritization of requests.
*   **Network Tomography Using Explicit Flow Measurements (Aik Kunz):**
    *   The presentation explored using explicit flow measurements (EFM) for network tomography, an approach usually done by active probing.
    *   Compared network tomography performance with active ping measurements, TCP probing, and several EFM techniques.
    *   EFM is done via production traffic with no extra traffic overhead.
    *   Demonstrated the use of path segmentation to improve EFM accuracy for network tomography.
    *   Highlighted challenges in practical application, including the need for path segmentation or a more general tomography methodology.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Action Item (Juan Sosa):** Consider comparing Phantom Link with Hypatia and other existing simulators.
*   **Action Item (Junze Way):** Consider comparing test case coverage with that of existing open source implementations.

## Next Steps

*   Continue research and development on LLM-based tools to assist IETF collaboration.
*   Explore smarter test case generation and establish test case evaluation metrics for automated protocol testing.
*   Further develop and evaluate Phantom Link for various satellite communication scenarios.
*   Improve the quality of parameter estimation in website load emulation.
*   Investigate solutions that doesn't need pass segmentation to apply this EFM technique.
