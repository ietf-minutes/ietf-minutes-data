## Summary

This session covered a range of topics related to transport protocols and network performance, including congestion control mechanisms, measurements of TCP performance over satellite internet, performance variability in QUIC implementations, acknowledgement cascades in multi-hop masking, and a fallback issue in TCP Prague. The session included presentations from researchers and engineers followed by Q&A and concluded with one minute pitches from poster authors and a poster session.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Careful Resume (Nico):**
    *   Explored a mechanism to reuse knowledge from previous connections to speed up the initial ramp-up of congestion windows.
    *   Employs a reconnaissance phase with RTT comparison to ensure path consistency.
    *   Safe Retreat mechanism to handle situations where network conditions have changed.
    *   Discussion on the fairness of Kaffir Resume compared to slow start.
    *   The flow completion time for background flows doesn't change dramatically.
*   **TCP Performance over Starlink:**
    *   Measurements of TCP congestion control performance using various TCP variants over Starlink.
    *   Observed limitations in single-flow TCP performance due to the microscopic behavior of Starlink resource allocation.
    *   BBRv3 showed promising fairness characteristics compared to BBRv1.
    *   Performance variations over time suggest changes in Starlink's network configuration or resource allocation.
    *   Microscopic behaviour of Starlink in terms of resource allocation and delay impacts congestion control.
*   **QUIC Throughput Speed Bumps:**
    *   Investigated performance variability among different QUIC implementations.
    *   Identified protocol implementation choices, I/O, and cryptography as key bottlenecks.
    *   Demonstrated that Linux UDP is not a significant bottleneck with proper optimizations.
    *   Suggested pipelining as a means to improve QUIC performance without compromising flexibility.
    *   There is a performance improvement if we provide some guidance on how to design and accelerate the implementations
*   **Cascades of Nested Acknowledgments in Multi-Hop Mask:**
    *   Examined the phenomenon of cascading acknowledgments in multi-hop masking.
    *   Encapsulation and masking may elicit additional acknowledgments.
    *   Analyzed that this could potentially be exponential based on the number of proxies.
    *   Increasing acknowledgement delay and aggregation can mitigate the overhead.
    *   Potential privacy implications due to traffic analysis based on distinct packet sizes from encapsulated acknowledgments.
*   **Reproducing and Solving a Fallback Issue in TCP Prague:**
    *   Reproduced contradictory results on TCP Prague's fallback mechanism's performance.
    *   Identified a bug in the implementation related to mismatched scaling factors.
    *   Demonstrated improved performance with the bug fixed.
    *   Fallback mechanism now correctly works.
*   **Poster Session Pitches:**
    *   Africa infrastructure measurement and suboptimal routing minimisation.
    *   DNS security analysis.
    *   "Switch Homing" approach that utilises mobile devices and multipath protocols to seamlessly switch providers.
    *   Decentralized social applications and a lack of application-independent namespaces for user identities.
    *   Traffic prioritization generating unexpected traffic in some schedulers.
    *   Tools finding unstandardised TTL results.
    *   Sampling prefixes.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Action Item:** Lucas Pardue to investigate the possibility of an option to eliminate data acknowledgments due to results shown by Katrin Hymnhorst in the cascades of nested acknowledgements talk.
*   **Action Item:** Janai Anghar mentioned there is definitely interest in figuring out how to treat these datagrams differently.

## Next Steps

*   Further investigate the fairness impact of Careful Resume with more detailed measurements.
*   Characterize loss for further understanding.
*   Evaluate impact on real world deployments.
*   Encourage QUIC implementers to focus on optimized crypto.
*   Explore the potential traffic analysis attacks from encapsulated acknowledgments.
*   Look at quick aware proxying draft in Mask.
