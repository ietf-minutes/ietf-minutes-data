## Summary

This document contains the minutes for the anrw session, covering a variety of topics related to network research. The session included presentations on anycast geolocation, MPLS network action stack management, predictable traffic in virtual switches, internet background radiation analysis, secure eBPF deployments, a QUIC protocol vulnerability, and DNSSEC post-quantum cryptography considerations.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Anycast Geolocation:**
    *   Discussion on the limitations of latency-based anycast geolocation methods.
    *   Presentation of a trace route-based approach for improved accuracy.
    *   Analysis of overcounting issues in the trace route method due to router configuration.
*   **MPLS Network Actions (MNA):**
    *   Explanation of the MNA framework and its use of reserved label values.
    *   Identification of challenges in HBH NAS preservation due to readable label depth (RLD) constraints.
    *   Proposal of an HBH preservation mechanism using a stack management network action to avoid parsing irrelevant LSEs.
    *   Proof-of-concept implementation on a hardware switching ASIC.
    *   Discussion on the compatibility of the mechanism with brownfield networks.
*   **Predictable Traffic in Virtual Switches:**
    *   Discussion of the bottleneck of a slow path in SDN environments
    *   Benefits of pre-installing rules to reduce latency
    *   Proposal to predict traffic in Open vSwitch (OVS) in OpenShift
    *   Discussions on the use of "coflows" to find a type of cluster traffic that could be generalized
    *   Tests using CPU, latency, and up call statistics on OVS
*   **Internet Background Radiation (IBR) Analysis:**
    *   Definition of IBR and the limitations of traditional network telescopes (darknets).
    *   Introduction of the "refractive telescope" concept utilizing ICMP error messages.
    *   Discussion of the capability to detect reflection DDoS attacks.
    *   Experiment results from a transit ISP network.
    *   Mention of the need to filter out low-activity IBR sources and classify malicious IP addresses.
*   **Secure eBPF Deployments:**
    *   Challenges in eBPF deployments, including verifier vulnerabilities and lack of provenance tracking.
    *   Proposal of a framework using manifests and signed byte identity verification.
    *   Description of the manifest structure containing metadata, attach rules, and permissions.
    *   Discussion of the loader component for policy enforcement before eBPF program execution.
*   **QUIC Protocol Vulnerability (Optimistic Ack Attack):**
    *   Explanation of the optimistic hack attack where clients acknowledge packets they haven't received.
    *   Demonstration of the ability to exploit the attack against multiple QUIC server implementations.
    *   Discussion on the difficulty of middleboxes detecting the attack due to end-to-end encryption.
    *   Real-network experiment results showing increased bandwidth from a CDN despite a client-side limit.
*   **DNSSEC Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC):**
    *   Overview of DNSSEC and the importance of signature sizes.
    *   Comparison of Falcon signature sizes in compressed and padded formats.
    *   Analysis of real-world data from the .NL DNSSEC-signed zone.
    *   Conclusion that padded Falcon signatures offer a better trade-off due to predictable size.
*   **Secure Autonomic IoT Device Management**
    *   Proposed framework using Chic Zero and Brusky to enable scalable and secure onboarding for constrained IoT devices
    *   Use of Chic Zero to compress messages required for onboarding defined in Bruski
    *   Experiment Setup using MathLab to test if the framework is feasible

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **IBR Analysis:** Marwan Fed suggested exploring the potential for open-sourcing or sharing IBR data collection and analysis methods within the community, possibly under the IETF or IRTF. Discussion about the term "radiation" to be discussed off-line.

## Next Steps

*   **eBPF:** Standardize manifest format and policy language for entire probability.
*   **QUIC:** Continue to engage with QUIC maintainers regarding the optimistic hack vulnerability and potential mitigations.
*   **IoT Management:** Implement Framework on a real LoRa, and perform deeper security analyses and performance benchmarking
