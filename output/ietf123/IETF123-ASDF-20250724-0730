# ASDF Working Group Meeting

## Summary

The ASDF working group held an in-person meeting to discuss several key drafts including digital twin modeling, non-affordances information, and instance information. The session focused on architectural discussions around extending SDF to handle metadata and contextual information that falls outside traditional affordances (properties, actions, events). The group also received updates on the NIPSI protocol work and discussed procedural matters including document adoption and authoring.

## Key Discussion Points

### Architecture and Document Relationships
- **Elephant analogy**: Carsten noted that the three main drafts (non-affordances, digital twin, instance information) represent different perspectives on the same architectural challenge rather than competing approaches
- **Instance vs Model distinction**: Critical need to separate instance representation formats from models, which is new to the SDF architecture
- **Terminology challenges**: Discussion around naming conventions, with "SDF context" preferred over "SDF non-affordances" for descriptive metadata

### SDF Extensions for Non-Affordances Information
- **Purpose**: Introduce structured way to represent non-interactive, descriptive metadata within SDF models
- **Rationale**: Real-world things require metadata like physical dimensions, installation location, manufacturer info, certification data
- **Implementation**: Lightweight, backward-compatible extension using new SDF class
- **Runtime messages**: Three types proposed - context snapshot, identity manifest, and context patch

### Digital Twin Modeling
- **Standards alignment**: Based on ISO digital twin standards with SDF extensions
- **Information attributes**: Static data (identifier, location, owner) vs dynamic data (status, maintenance)
- **Relationships**: Three types defined - physical, functional, and semantic relationships
- **Implementation procedure**: Eight-step process for digital twin implementation

### Instance Information Draft
- **Scope**: Focuses on runtime instance messages and contextual metadata in operational data
- **New concepts**: Proof shots (device status overview), constructors (initialization), event history
- **Protocol mapping**: Needs to work across different ecosystems beyond just NIPSI

### NIPSI Protocol Updates
- **Status**: Draft version 10 released with hackathon-driven improvements
- **Major issues resolved**:
  - Moving from path parameters to query parameters to avoid server implementation issues with encoded characters
  - Protocol mapping generalization beyond non-IP protocols
  - New NIPSI-specific problem type registry
  - Media type handling improvements

## Decisions and Action Items

### Technical Decisions
- **Query parameters**: Consensus to move NIPSI API from path to query parameters to resolve server compatibility issues
- **Protocol mapping**: Agreement to split protocol mapping into separate draft from NIPSI
- **Problem types**: Create NIPSI-specific problem type registry rather than using generic HTTP registry
- **Media types**: Introduce `application/nipsi+json` media type for NIPSI-specific formats

### Document Actions
- **SDF Relations**: Lorenzo to become co-author to advance this document
- **Protocol Mapping**: Extract as separate draft from NIPSI (no adoption call needed for split documents)
- **SKIM Extension**: Create separate draft for SDF extensions to SKIM device model

### Process Items
- **Working Group Adoption**: Discussion on timing - some prefer early adoption to show working group interest, others prefer waiting until approach is clearer
- **Author Recruitment**: Need approximately 3 more active authors across documents to reduce dependency on current core contributors

## Next Steps

### Scheduled Meetings
- **Virtual Interim**: August 20th, 10:00 Helsinki time (accommodating global timezone challenges)
- **September Interim**: TBD, similar timing
- **Montreal IETF**: Plan comprehensive document hackathon focused on collaborative editing rather than presentations

### Immediate Work Items
- Continue resolving remaining NIPSI GitHub issues (~49 open, ~15 ready to close)
- Progress architectural discussion on non-affordances/context/instance information convergence
- Begin work on separated protocol mapping draft
- Address URL encoding issues as broader IETF concern (coordinate with area directors)

### Long-term Goals
- Converge the three main drafts into coherent architectural approach
- Establish clear model vs instance separation in SDF ecosystem
- Expand implementation testing (potential IETF network experiments with Wi-Fi 7 APs)
- Increase working group participation and authorship diversity
