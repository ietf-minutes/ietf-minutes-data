## Summary
The dance working group met to discuss the status of current documents, a new work proposal from Philip Hallam-Baker regarding DNS handles and TLS Client Auth for IoT, and the future of the working group itself. Philip's proposal generated significant discussion about its scope, feasibility, and alignment with the working group's charter.  The group also discussed whether to keep the working group open or close it.

## Key Discussion Points
*   **Current Document Status:** Three active documents are nearing publication.  Shepherd documents have been submitted, and final changes are pending.
*   **Philip Hallam-Baker's Proposal:**
    *   Vision: DNS as the primary identity system, with every host having a DNS name.
    *   Handle Service Providers:  Extending DNS registrars to manage DNS names on behalf of users, providing OAuth identity providers, and Acme relays.
    *   IoT Authentication: Using TLS Client Auth with DNS handles to authenticate users to IoT devices directly.
    *   Offline Operation: Ensuring authentication works even when internet connectivity is down, potentially using private CAs and local DNS infrastructure.
    *   Privacy Concerns: Addressed concerns about super cookies and the need for user control over identity profiles.
    *   Split DNS and Security: Concerns raised about complexity and security implications of split DNS for home users.
*   **Working Group Future:** The future depends on the ability to find sufficient people that are prepared to review, help develop, shepherd and in all other ways advance the work within the group.

## Decisions and Action Items
*   **Philip Hallam-Baker:** Create a draft proposal that addresses the discussion and is aligned to the Dane charter.
*   **Dance Mailing List:** The mailing list will be used to discuss new ideas and the dance charter to see if a recharter is a worthwhile pursuit.
*   **Chairs:** Set a deadline coinciding with the other three documents getting through IETF last call for determining whether there is enough support to recharter the group.

## Next Steps
*   Philip will work on a draft proposal and engage with the mailing list.
*   The group will continue to discuss and solicit support for rechartering.
*   If there is not enough support to recharter, the Dance working group will close after existing documents are published.
