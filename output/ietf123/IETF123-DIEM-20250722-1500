# diem Working Group Meeting Minutes

## Summary

The diem (Digital Emblems) working group held its first official meeting after being chartered. The session focused on reviewing the proposed use cases and requirements document structure, presented by Rahel Feinstein and Felix Linker. The working group discussed five main use cases: Red Cross/Red Crescent/Red Crystal emblems, Blue Shield emblems, press protection, OPCW chemical transit protection, and Ramsar wetlands protection. Key discussions centered on stakeholder engagement, scope limitations, and document structure. The working group conducted three consensus polls to gauge preferences on stakeholder participation requirements, inclusion of partial-scope use cases, and prioritization approaches.

## Key Discussion Points

### Use Cases Presented
- **Humanitarian emblems**: Red Cross, Red Crescent, Red Crystal for medical personnel and assets
- **Cultural protection**: Blue Shield emblem for culturally significant assets
- **Press protection**: Digital emblems for journalists and press equipment as non-combatants
- **Chemical transit**: OPCW protection for sensitive chemicals in transit with selective disclosure
- **Environmental protection**: Ramsar wetlands with geographic querying capabilities

### Requirements Analysis
- Common requirements across use cases: authenticity, authorization, removability
- Specific requirements: undetectable validation, selective disclosure, geographic querying
- Distinction between requirements fully within initial charter scope versus those requiring future rechartering

### Scope and Charter Limitations
- Initial charter limits technical mechanisms to DNS-based solutions
- Debate over including use cases that extend beyond initial scope
- Discussion of physical objects versus digital-only assets
- Concerns about "boiling the ocean" versus being comprehensive for future work

### Stakeholder Engagement Concerns
- Strong emphasis on need for stakeholder participation, particularly for press use case
- Article 19 raised concerns about potential risks to journalists from digital emblems
- Discussion of challenges in engaging "attackers" who might review emblems
- Need for risk assessments and extensive consultation across different regions

### Document Structure Options
- Debate between single comprehensive document versus multiple use-case-specific documents
- Preference emerged for single document to identify patterns and requirements overlap
- Agreement on need to clearly mark which requirements are within initial scope

## Decisions and Action Items

### Document Approach
- **Decision**: Proceed with single comprehensive use cases and requirements document
- **Action**: Authors (Rahel and Felix) to create new consolidated draft incorporating feedback
- **Guideline**: Focus working group discussion time on requirements covered by initial scope while not preventing inclusion of non-controversial out-of-scope requirements

### Stakeholder Engagement
- **Action**: Chairs to continue outreach efforts to bring more stakeholders, particularly press organizations and potential "attackers"
- **Action**: Encourage stakeholder participation through mailing list for those unable to attend meetings
- **Requirement**: Each use case must demonstrate reasonable stakeholder evaluation and support

### Scope Clarification
- **Decision**: Include dangerous forces and civil defense emblems (recognized under international humanitarian law)
- **Guideline**: Include use cases with partial scope coverage if the in-scope requirements provide useful functionality
- **Action**: Authors to clearly mark which requirements are within initial charter scope versus future scope

## Next Steps

- Authors will produce new consolidated use cases and requirements draft for working group review
- Continued outreach to stakeholders, particularly for press and environmental protection use cases
- Mailing list discussion to refine requirements and provide text suggestions
- Focus on developing consensus around requirements that fall within initial charter scope
- Future architecture document will follow once use cases and requirements achieve consensus

The working group demonstrated good collaborative discussion and established a clear path forward for the first deliverable while acknowledging the need for continued stakeholder engagement and careful scope management.
