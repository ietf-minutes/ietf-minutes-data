# dnsop

## Summary

This was the first dnsop working group session on Monday, featuring introductions of new leadership and discussion of four main technical drafts. The session included welcome remarks for new working group chair Andre and technical advisor Jim, along with farewell acknowledgments to outgoing chairs Suzanne and Tim. The main technical discussions focused on DNS structured errors, public resolver errors, IPv6 transport guidelines, and domain verification techniques.

## Key Discussion Points

### Leadership Changes and Administrative Updates
- **New Leadership**: Andre introduced as new working group chair alongside existing chair Benno
- **Support Team**: Shuman and Peter confirmed as secretariat support, Jim as technical advisor
- **Document Status**: Multiple RFCs in editor queue expected to be published before next meeting
- **Hackathon Results**: DNS table work included residual case synchronization, private OIDs/algorithms for post-quantum crypto testing, and MTL mode implementation in BIND

### DNS Structured Errors Draft Discussion
- **Current State**: Draft returned to working group after IESG last call due to feedback
- **Key Issues**:
  - Use of EDE option in queries vs responses (violates RFC 8914)
  - Two proposed solutions: new option code or server-side only responses
  - Sub-error code categories - currently limited to security-related codes
  - Trust model for displaying information (trusted vs untrusted resolvers)
- **Implementation Feedback**: Apple and Mozilla representatives confirmed interest and existing implementations

### Public Resolver Errors Draft
- **Use Case**: Making web censorship more transparent, specifically for web browsers
- **Required Information**: Identity of blocking party, blocking authority, reason for blocking, URI for more information
- **Security Challenge**: Information is unauthenticated and could be misused for attacks
- **Browser Vendor Input**: Chrome and Firefox representatives confirmed interest and described trust mechanisms for determining when to display information

### IPv6 Transport Guidelines (RFC 3901bis)
- **Problem**: RFC 3901 from 2004 treats IPv6 as optional, leading to lower IPv6 adoption in DNS
- **Research Results**: 
  - IPv4 and IPv6 resolution performance within 3% difference
  - Fragmentation has minimal impact on DNS resolution
  - Misconfigured IPv6 has greater impact than fragment dropping
- **Proposed Changes**: Make IPv4 and IPv6 equal requirements for authoritative servers

### Domain Verification Techniques
- **Recent Changes**: Version 0.09 introduces distinction between one-off vs persistent validation
- **Open Issues**:
  - Token definition (random vs unique tokens)
  - DNSSEC validation requirement (should vs must)
  - Process concerns raised about extensive changes without working group discussion

## Decisions and Action Items

### DNS Structured Errors
- **Decision Needed**: Choose between new option code (Option A) or server-side only responses (Option B)
- **Implementation Input**: Strong preference from implementers for client signaling capability
- **Security Model**: Discussion needed on trusted vs untrusted resolver behavior

### Public Resolver Errors
- **Convergence Needed**: Determine if information should be limited in protocol specification or handled via security considerations
- **Browser Vendor Approach**: Preference for receiving all data and making trust decisions in client

### Process Decisions
- **Interim Meeting**: Likely needed for structured DNS errors discussion due to time constraints
- **Working Group Consideration**: Suggestion to charter focused working group for censorship-related work
- **Technical Advisor Input**: Recommendation to combine drafts through interim meetings rather than new working group

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
- **CDS Consistency Draft**: Last call to be closed this week
- **Domain Verification**: Authors to address process concerns about changes made without working group discussion
- **IPv6 Transport**: Document appears ready for working group last call pending final review

### Upcoming Sessions
- **Friday Session**: Next dnsop meeting scheduled
- **Interim Meetings**: Planned for DNS structured errors discussion
- **Mailing List Discussion**: Continued technical discussion required for all drafts

### Document Progression
- **DNS Automation**: Needs revision before last call
- **Domain Verification**: Ready for last call, scheduled for agenda
- **DNS Revalidation**: Needs new revision and last call scheduling
- **IPv6 Transport**: Nearing last call readiness

The session concluded with emphasis on continuing discussions on the mailing list rather than only during meetings, and reminder of the Friday session in a different room.
