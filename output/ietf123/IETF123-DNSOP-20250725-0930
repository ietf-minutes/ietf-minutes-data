# dnsop

## Summary

The second DNS Operations (dnsop) session on Friday covered nine draft presentations and multiple adoption considerations. Key topics included persistent DNS references, DS automation recommendations, service binding mappings, DNSSEC algorithm rules, debugging techniques, zone delegation methods, cache synchronization, scanner notifications, and transport signaling. The working group received numerous requests for draft adoptions, with chairs noting they could only accommodate two-thirds of agenda requests and will deliberate on adoptions via the mailing list.

## Key Discussion Points

### Best Practices for Persistent References in DNS
- **Presenter**: Andrew Kayser
- Discussion on using DNSSEC for cryptographically verifiable associations between DNS domain names and persistent references (CAA records, wallet addresses, social media handles)
- Convergence potential with the DCV BCP draft currently in RFC Editor queue
- Agreement on using DNSSEC validation when zones are signed, rather than requiring DNSSEC everywhere

### Operational Recommendations for DS Automation
- **Presenter**: Peter (representing draft for GTLD registries)
- Five main recommendation areas: validity checks, TTL management, error reporting, EPP locks handling, and multiple submission sources
- ICANN currently blocks GTLD registries from DS automation due to unclear operational practices
- Key contentious points: email notifications scaling, registry lock interpretation, and periodic validation requirements

### Service Binding Mapping for Background Requests
- **Presenter**: Gauta Makiawate
- Proposal for new SVCB parameter "background priority" to distinguish latency-sensitive vs background traffic
- Allows clients to dynamically discover endpoints optimized for background requests
- Several concerns raised about filtering mechanisms and naming conventions

### Multiple Algorithm Rules in DNSSEC
- **Presenter**: Shumon
- Proposal to selectively relax DNSSEC signing requirements for "universal algorithms" (8, 13)
- Strong opposition from Mark Andrews and Jim Reid citing security concerns and complexity
- Support from Philip with modifications to validator requirements

### DNS Debugging with probe.resolver.arpa
- **Presenter**: Paul Hoffman
- Proposes standardized domain for DNS debugging instead of example.com
- Testing shows comparable performance and reliability
- Addresses privacy concerns of client identification in debug queries

### Zone Cut to Nowhere
- **Presenter**: Joe Abley
- Mechanism for handling namespace conflicts between public and private DNS
- Uses empty delegation target (dot) to avoid cryptographic proof of non-existence
- Mark Andrews expressed safety concerns about resolver behavior

### Synchronizing Caches Between DNS Resolvers
- **Presenter**: Not specified in transcript
- Proposal for cache sharing between cooperating resolvers in trusted networks
- Concerns raised about ECS complications, DNSSEC validation status, and practical benefits

### Generalized Notifications Extensions
- **Presenter**: Johan
- Two small extensions for scanner frequency signaling and negative signaling
- Uses port numbers to indicate scanner frequency when no notification receiver exists
- Discussion on timer units (seconds vs minutes) and registrar vs registry scanner roles

### Opportunistic DNS Transport Signaling
- **Presenter**: Johan
- Pre-DELEG solution for signaling DOT/DOQ support via SVCB records in additional section
- Addresses operational concerns with blind probing approach from RFC 9539
- Ben Schwartz noted this is already possible within existing RFC 9461 framework

## Decisions and Action Items

- **Working Group Adoption**: Chairs will deliberate on multiple adoption requests and communicate decisions via mailing list due to high volume of requests
- **Draft Convergence**: Authors of persistent references and DCV BCP drafts to continue discussions on potential merger
- **Mailing List Follow-up**: Several presentations explicitly directed further discussion to the mailing list due to time constraints

## Next Steps

- Continue detailed discussions on all presented drafts via the dnsop mailing list
- Authors to incorporate feedback received during presentations
- Working group chairs to announce adoption decisions for pending drafts
- Further collaboration between related draft authors (particularly persistent references and DCV BCP)
- Additional technical analysis needed for several proposals, particularly cache synchronization measurements and zone cut delegation safety
