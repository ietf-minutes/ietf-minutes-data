## Summary
The Gaia session at IETF 123 featured three presentations focused on innovative approaches to internet access and infrastructure, particularly in underserved communities. The presentations covered a local platform-as-a-service solution in Uganda (Crane Cloud), a decentralized DNS system for community networks (Sig Zero Name Control), and efforts to measure connectivity performance in rural regions, with a focus on integrating social and technical aspects.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Crane Cloud (Alex):**
    *   Addressed challenges of cloud service access in resource-constrained environments like Africa.
    *   Presented Crane Cloud as a local, vendor-independent platform-as-a-service for application deployment and data management.
    *   Highlighted its use as an educational platform for DevOps, cloud computing, and showcasing student work.
    *   Discussed the architecture of Crane Cloud, based on microservices and supporting integration with various cloud providers.
    *   Showcased the platform's growth to over a thousand users and its support for various workloads, including AI/ML.
    *   Alex is interested in working with users in other geographic areas beyond Uganda.

*   **Sig Zero Name Control (Adam):**
    *   Introduced Sig Zero Name Control, a project designed to facilitate services within community networks using DNS and DNSSEC.
    *   Explained how it allows strong access control to altering the DNS system, empowering community members to publish and find local resources.
    *   Emphasized its low resource requirements and potential for integration with existing services and open-source routers.
    *   Described the architecture, including browser applications, command-line tools, and the process for requesting new subdomains.
    *   Presented GUI applications for domain management, service discovery, and collaborative mapping using DNS LOC records.

*   **Connectivity Performance Measurement for Rural Regions (Ritu):**
    *   Focused on the challenges of measuring internet connectivity performance in rural areas and the need to integrate social and technical factors.
    *   Discussed the limitations of existing measurement tools in capturing user-centric aspects and the specific needs of small operators.
    *   Highlighted the importance of accurate measurement for improving connectivity, informing policy, and empowering users.
    *   Outlined an approach that is context-sensitive, technically feasible, user-centric, and actionable.
    *   Described the goal of creating an affordable and easily deployable measurement tool for small operators to improve their service.
    *   Ritu requested help in using the framework by other network operators.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Action Item:** Ritu will share her email address in the chat for individuals interested in participating in case studies or using the connectivity measurement framework.
*   **Action Item:** Jane will connect Ritu with members of the local broadband mapping community in the US.
*   **Adam will investigate NSEC3 to prevent zone walking and privacy issues.**

## Next Steps

*   Crane Cloud: Continue to expand the platform's reach, particularly within Africa.
*   Sig Zero Name Control: Implement the new DNSSEC standards (RFC 9644 and 9655) and incorporate the system into OpenWRT router images.
*   Connectivity Performance Measurement: Seek case studies and collaboration with network operators to test and refine the measurement framework.
