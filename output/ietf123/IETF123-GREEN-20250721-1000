# Green Working Group Session

## Summary

The Green Working Group held its first session focusing on three draft documents for potential adoption and related work presentations. The session covered liaison statements from other standards organizations, draft presentations on use cases, terminology, and framework documents, along with two presentations on energy-aware routing work from other working groups. The chairs emphasized the importance of mailing list participation to support adoption decisions and outlined plans for interim meetings and hackathon discussions in the following session.

## Key Discussion Points

### Liaison Statements
- Received liaisons from W3C regarding coordination on energy efficiency activities
- ITU-T and ETSI provided replies to the working group's introductory liaison statement, pointing to relevant ongoing work
- Chair offered to share summaries of liaison responses on the mailing list

### Draft Presentations

#### Use Cases Document (draft-ietf-green-use-cases)
- Document updated to version 2 with improved template structure
- Framework material moved to separate framework document
- Two new use cases added, with emphasis on double counting risk issues
- Previous adoption poll was unsuccessful due to insufficient mailing list support
- Virtual poll showed reasonable number of participants had read the document
- Plans for second adoption poll after the meeting

#### Terminology Document (draft-ietf-green-terminology)
- Presented by Qin Wu with multiple co-authors including new contributor Slash
- Document has been around since IETF 121-122, presented at recent interim meetings
- Version 04 adds new section on operational management considerations
- Five new energy efficiency terms added based on interim meeting feedback
- 70+ terms currently defined, focusing on key terminology and reusing existing IETF definitions
- GitHub repository established for tracking open issues
- Strong support shown in adoption poll (24 yes votes)

#### Framework Document (draft-ietf-green-framework)
- Relatively new document (first version posted in May) by Benoit and co-authors
- Presents architecture covering network domain level down to individual components
- Addresses power distribution topology discovery challenges
- Introduces concepts of power source relationships, energy objects, and metering relationships
- Discusses device capabilities, power states, and intent mapping
- Highlights issues with double counting in energy measurements
- Multiple open issues identified including capability discovery and SLA considerations
- Document considered potentially good basis for framework but premature for adoption

### Technical Discussion Points
- **Energy efficiency vs. energy usage metrics**: Joe Clark raised concerns about clarity between measuring efficiency improvements over time versus general energy consumption
- **Power distribution topology**: Unlike network topology, power distribution cannot be discovered through CDP/LLDP, requiring explicit metering relationships
- **Double counting prevention**: Critical issue when aggregating energy consumption across components with power dependencies
- **Device capabilities and power states**: Need for standardized discovery mechanisms and clear definitions of power state implications

### Related Work Presentations

#### Energy-Aware QoS Integration
- Ruth Sophia presented draft on integrating energy metrics into QoS models
- Proposes using DiffServ as representative QoS model with energy awareness
- Targets telco cloud environments with multi-tenant considerations
- Suggests experimental code points for energy-sensitive traffic
- Work considered out of scope for Green WG but of broader IETF interest
- Virtual poll showed support (30 yes) for progressing work within IETF

#### Energy Efficiency Routing
- Jin Ming He presented work on energy consumption aware routing
- Focuses on IGP and BGP protocol extensions for energy data collection
- Proposes three-step process: indicator definition, data collection, path calculation
- Work primarily targeted at LSR, IDR, and Spring working groups
- Includes threshold mechanisms to prevent frequent path switching

## Decisions and Action Items

### Adoption Decisions
- **Terminology document**: Strong in-room support for adoption, to be confirmed on mailing list
- **Use cases document**: Second adoption poll to be conducted on mailing list after meeting
- **Framework document**: Not ready for adoption but recognized as potential future candidate

### Action Items
- Chairs to conduct mailing list adoption polls for terminology and use cases documents
- Participants encouraged to respond to mailing list polls to demonstrate support
- Framework document links to be shared in chat for review
- Chair to potentially share liaison response summaries on mailing list
- Energy-aware QoS work to be discussed with area directors for potential IETF progression path

## Next Steps

- **Terminology document**: Mailing list confirmation of adoption decision
- **Use cases document**: Second adoption cycle with mailing list poll
- **Framework document**: Encourage community review and feedback, discuss open issues in tomorrow's session
- **Interim meetings**: Plans for additional informal interim meetings going forward
- **Tomorrow's session**: Focus on hackathon recap, new draft proposals, and detailed discussion of modeling work and framework open issues
- **Related work coordination**: Continue liaison activities with other SDOs and working groups

The session emphasized the importance of mailing list participation to ensure adoption decisions reflect genuine community support beyond in-room polls.
