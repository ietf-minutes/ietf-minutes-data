# Hackathon Kickoff

## Summary

The IETF Hackathon kickoff session welcomed participants to the Madrid event, providing essential information for new attendees and reviewing procedures for the two-day hackathon. The session covered logistics, contribution guidelines, project organization, and presentation requirements. Approximately 35 projects are expected to participate, with both main and overflow rooms at capacity.

## Key Discussion Points

### Welcome and Introductions
- Strong attendance with main room and overflow room both nearly full
- New participants and students specifically welcomed to their first IETF hackathon
- Emphasis on socialization, idea discussion, and community engagement

### Hackathon Purpose and Goals
- Test implementations of specifications from IETF drafts
- Increase open source community involvement in IETF
- Focus on interoperability and "running code"
- Provide feedback to working groups on draft specifications
- Bridge the gap between specifications and implementation

### Guidelines and Policies
- **Note Well**: All participants must familiarize themselves with IETF note well, contribution guidelines, and code of conduct
- **Code Ownership**: Participants retain ownership of developed code and should consider open source licensing
- **IP Considerations**: All presentations and contributions become IETF contributions and will be publicly available
- **Code of Conduct**: Emphasis on friendly, cooperative, and constructive interaction

### Project Organization
- Project champions encouraged to add projects to hackathon wiki
- Wiki serves as archive and reference for achievements, presentations, and code repositories
- Mailing list available for project coordination and volunteer recruitment
- "Lost and found" section on wiki for matching skills with project needs
