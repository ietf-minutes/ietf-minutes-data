# httpbis

## Summary

The httpbis working group met to discuss several active drafts and the possibility of rechartering the group. Key topics included Layered Cookies, the QUERY method, Resumable Uploads, Incremental HTTP Messages, and a proposal for detecting outdated proxy configurations. Discussions covered technical details, potential implementation challenges, and alignment with existing standards.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Rechartering:** The group discussed updating the charter to reflect current activities focused on maintaining and developing HTTP extensions. The proposed charter update removes references to completed core work.
*   **Layered Cookies:** An update was provided on the layered cookies draft, which aims to abstract browser-specific requirements. Feedback was requested on reconciling client and server requirements.
*   **QUERY Method:** The discussion focused on defining selected representations and handling conditionals for the QUERY method. There were differing opinions on whether to treat QUERY like GET or POST for conditional requests. The impact on caching was also discussed.
*   **Resumable Uploads:** An update was provided on the resumable uploads draft, which is nearing completion. Interoperability testing and production experience were highlighted. A working group last call was requested.
*   **Incremental HTTP Messages:** The group discussed updates to the incremental HTTP messages draft, which clarifies the use of the incremental header field for bi-directional byte streaming. A working group last call was requested.
*   **Detecting Outdated Proxy Configurations:** A new proposal was presented for detecting outdated proxy configurations using a client header and a server response header. The discussion covered potential use cases, security considerations, and alternative approaches.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Rechartering:** The group will continue discussions with the area director regarding the proposed charter update.
*   **QUERY Method:** Julian and Mike will continue to work on defining selected representations and handling conditionals for the QUERY method, considering the impact on caching.
*   **Resumable Uploads:** The working group will start the process for a last call on the resumable uploads draft.
*   **Incremental HTTP Messages:** The working group will start the process for a last call on the incremental HTTP messages draft. Editors will look for client implementation information to include in the draft.
*   **Detecting Outdated Proxy Configurations:** Yaroslav and team will continue refining the proposal, taking into account the feedback received during the meeting. The HTTP request proxying draft from Ben Schwartz may influence it.

## Next Steps

*   Continue discussions on the mailing lists for the QUERY method, proxy configuration detection, and other relevant topics.
*   Begin working group last calls for the Resumable Uploads and Incremental HTTP Messages drafts.
*   Hold the next httpbis meeting on Friday to discuss additional active drafts.
