# httpbis

## Summary

The HTTPbis working group discussed several active drafts and new proposals. The discussions focused on Unencoded Digests, Secondary Certs, TCP Connect, and Version Translation of the Capsule Protocol. A new proposal for HTTP Request Proxying was also presented. Key themes included addressing implementation challenges, clarifying specifications, and evaluating the need for standardization in specific areas.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Unencoded Digests:**
    *   Discussion on parameterization of digest fields and potential inconsistencies between the new and old drafts.
    *   Consideration of options including doing nothing, filing an erratum, or issuing a BIS to update existing RFCs.
    *   Clarification that unrecognized parameters should be ignored by default according to Structured Fields.
*   **Secondary Certs:**
    *   Discussion on handling large secondary certificates over HTTP/2 and potential head-of-line blocking issues.
    *   Consideration of a new stream type or server certificate promise frame similar to server push.
    *   Alternative proposal to focus on HTTP/3 over QMux due to limitations of HTTP/2.
    *   General sentiment to keep the specification simple and address more complex issues later if necessary.
*   **TCP Connect:**
    *   Discussion on new connection closure rules and handling of TCP FIN and RESET flags.
    *   Considerations for resource exhaustion attacks and recommendations for limiting receive windows.
    *   Recommendations to avoid HTTP 1.1 were discussed.
    *   Detailed discussion on how to signal resets across different HTTP versions, especially in HTTP 1.1.
*   **Version Translation of the Capsule Protocol:**
    *   Proposal to declare that capsule protocol requests can be translated freely across HTTP versions.
    *   Discussion on potential restrictions on future upgrade tokens.
    *   Concerns about web transport and the need for exceptions or alternative solutions.
    *   Debate on the value of automatic translation versus explicit specification.
    *   Discussion on MTAU in datagram translation and potential codex.
*   **HTTP Request Proxying:**
    *   Presentation of a proposal for templated proxies to address limitations of traditional forward proxies.
    *   Concerns about the security implications of delegating all identity to the proxy.
    *   Alternative suggestions like oblivious HTTP.
    *   Discussion about use cases for proxy usage related to client version incompatibilities.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Unencoded Digests:**
    *   The authors will prepare a PR with recommended text changes to ensure consistency.
    *   The working group to decide whether it needs last call
*   **TCP Connect:**
    *   Authors will prepare a PR to simplify text regarding TLS alerts and abrupt stream closure.
    *   The specification to be prepared for working group last call after PR is submitted.
    *   The group should aim to schedule an interrupt test.
*   **Version Translation of the Capsule Protocol:**
    *   Authors to continue discussion on the mailing list based on feedback received.

## Next Steps

*   Authors of each draft to incorporate feedback and prepare updated revisions.
*   Discussion on Version Translation of the Capsule Protocol to continue on the mailing list.
