# ianabis

## Summary

The ianabis working group met at IETF 123 to discuss the status of four documents and work toward working group last call for each. The session focused primarily on draft-ietf-ianabis-rfc8126bis with extensive discussion on specification requirements, particularly whether Internet-Drafts should count as valid specifications. The group also addressed the status of three other documents: draft-borman (early registry creation), draft-klensin (hybrid procedures), and draft-ietf-ianabis-rfc7120bis.

## Key Discussion Points

### Specification Required Policy (RFC 8126bis)

- **Internet-Drafts as Specifications**: Extended discussion on whether IDs should count as valid specifications under "specification required" policy
  - Consensus emerged that this should be determined by working groups when creating registries, or by designated experts when not specified
  - For prospective registries: working groups should explicitly state what specification types are acceptable
  - For retrospective registries: designated experts should work with cognizant ADs to consult the community when making policy decisions

- **IANA Storing Specifications**: Discussion on whether IANA should investigate storing specifications to ensure permanent availability
  - Consensus was that current IANA practices are adequate
  - No additional burden should be placed on IANA for spec storage at this time

- **Status Fields**: Working group agreed to remain silent on defining status field examples (deprecated, obsolete, etc.) in this document iteration

### Document Integration Strategy

- **Draft-borman Integration**: Decided to merge Carson Borman's draft into RFC 8126bis rather than maintain as standalone document
- **Draft-klensin Integration**: Similarly decided to merge John Klensin's hybrid procedure text into RFC 8126bis
- Both editors agreed to work with Barry Leiba on consolidating text into single document

### Other Documents Status

- **RFC 7120bis**: Confirmed as ready for working group last call after verification that Carson's document issues are already addressed
- **Early Registries Draft**: Ready for working group adoption call, with intent to move quickly to last call afterward

## Decisions and Action Items

### Text Writing Assignments

- **Paul Hoffman**: Write prospective text for specification requirements policy
- **Rich Salz**: Write retrospective text for designated expert consultation process  
- **Barry Leiba**: Write text explaining how working groups can create custom registry policies without new categories
- **Roman Juliet**: Write text on deprecated/obsolete terminology standardization
- **Working Group Chairs**: Confirm with Med Kucherawy whether module file subsection (13.3) is still needed

### Document Processing Actions

- **Chairs**: Issue working group last call for RFC 7120bis after IETF draft version is published
- **Chairs**: Issue adoption call for early registries draft, followed quickly by working group last call
- **Carson Borman & Barry Leiba**: Collaborate on merging Carson's draft text into RFC 8126bis
- **John Klensin**: Provide input for merging hybrid procedure concepts into RFC 8126bis

## Next Steps

1. All assigned authors to send proposed text to working group mailing list for discussion
2. Iterate on text proposals through mailing list discussions  
3. Working group chairs to issue adoption and last call notices as specified
4. Confirm RFC 7120bis coverage of Carson's document issues before proceeding to last call
5. Consolidate multiple draft inputs into single RFC 8126bis document for final working group review

The working group made significant progress toward the goal of reaching working group last call on all documents, with clear action items and timelines established for moving forward.
