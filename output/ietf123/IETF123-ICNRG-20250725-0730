## Summary

The ICNRG meeting included presentations on clock synchronization in information-centric networks, ICN applications for cybernetic avatars and metaverse environments, and a decentralized social media protocol called AtProto. Updates were provided on the status of the chunking draft, and a call for participation in draft reviews was issued. The next meeting is planned for Montreal.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Clock Synchronization:** Kathleen Nichols presented on clock synchronization in limited domains using the DEFT transport. The discussion focused on self-contained virtual clocks, collection-based communication, and failure-tolerant approaches. Quantization of differences and round-trip delay estimation were also covered.
*   **Cybernetic Avatars and Metaverse:** Yusak Hayamizu discussed ICN-based applications for cybernetic avatars (CA) and metaverse environments, including sharing teleoperation for multiple avatar robots and XR-based remote experiments. The C4 software, a CCNX 1.0 compliant implementation, was introduced.
*   **AtProto: Decentralized Social Media:** Daniel Holmgren presented AtProto, a decentralized social media protocol. Key aspects included location-independent and self-certifying data, user-rooted authority, generic data hosting, and a credible exit strategy. Addressing scheme using AT URIs was highlighted.
*   **Chunking Draft:** Hitoshi Asaeda provided a brief update, stating that the chunking draft is almost ready for last call. Community members were encouraged to review and provide feedback.
*   **Draft Reviews:** A strong call for participation in reviewing current drafts, specifically flick and reflexive forwarding, was made. More community input is needed to move these drafts forward.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Chunking Draft Last Call:** If no objections are raised within the next couple of weeks, the chunking draft will be submitted for a research group last call.
    *   Action: ICNRG Chairs (Lange/Cochetti) to send a message to the mailing list soliciting objections to last call.
*   **Flick Re-Spin:** Re-spin flick and issue a second last call in the next couple of months
    *   Action: Spin and issue a second last call.

## Next Steps

*   Submit chunking draft for research group last call (contingent on mailing list feedback).
*   Re-spin Flick
*   Plan for the next ICNRG meeting in Montreal in person. Call for presentations on recent ICN research.
