## Summary
The IDR working group meeting covered a wide range of BGP-related topics, including extensions for flow specification, SR policy, and new proposals for performance-aware routing and device discovery.  The meeting also included a brief discussion of the working group's rechartering efforts. Several drafts were presented and discussed, with calls for working group adoption on some. There were discussions about potential dependencies with other working groups such as SPRING, BEST, and TVR.

## Key Discussion Points
*   **Rechartering:** The proposed recharter aims to balance ongoing work with openness to future extensions, facilitate cross-working group reviews, and cover both underlay and limited overlay routing aspects of BGP.
*   **BGP Flow Specification Extensions (v2):** A proposal to use community containers to redirect traffic to secondary routing policies using FlowSpec v2. There was positive reception to the approach of using community containers.
*   **BGP SR Policy Extensions for Performance Metrics:** A proposal to add performance metrics to SR policy to influence path selection. Concerns were raised about the complexity of changing route selection and the generality of the metric.
*   **BGP SR Policy Extensions for Path Scheduling:** A draft proposing scheduled activation of SR policies. Concerns were raised about dependencies and potential overlap with TVR data models.
*   **SR Policy End Node SID Optimization:**  A draft proposing signalling whether the end-node SID in an SR policy should be suppressed.
*   **NVMf over RoCEv2 Device Discovery:** A proposal to use BGP to distribute device discovery information in NVMf over RoCEv2 networks.  The AD suggested this might be better suited for the BEST working group.
*   **Fully Adaptive Routing using BGP:** A proposal for a new BGP attribute to propagate bandwidth information for adaptive routing in AI networks. Concerns were raised about the introduction of a new BGP extended community and the potential for rapid changes and volatility.
*   **Incremental Update Accumulated Metric in NHC Report:** A draft proposing to add multiple metrics that a BGP speaker can advertise in the NHC, as well as what secondary metrics a receiving router could use in a class topology.
*   **BGP-Specific Route Reflector:** A proposal for a new BGP refresh message for specific route reflection. There was significant overlap with the route refresh options that's in the works.
*   **BGP Performance Aware Routing:** A draft proposing a separate SAFI to carry latency-based routing information. Strong concerns were raised about the volatility of latency as a routing metric and its suitability for BGP.

## Decisions and Action Items
*   **FlowSpec v2:** N/A, further reviews and comments are welcome.
*   **SR Policy extensions:** Authors to address concerns about code point formats and take discussion to the mailing list.
*   **Scheduling Extensions:** Authors to consider coordination and consistency with TVR models.
*   **SR Policy End Node SID Optimization:** Adoption to be discussed on the mailing list.
*   **NVMf RoCEv2 Device Discovery:** N/A, Author to consider the BEST WG as an alternative venue.
*   **Fully Adaptive Routing using BGP:** Author to address concerns about the proposed new attribute, consider existing link bandwidth solutions, add technical depth, and prepare IANA considerations before next adoption request.
*   **BGP Specific Route Reflector:** To consider and reference existing route refresh options.

## Next Steps
*   Continue discussions on the mailing list for all drafts presented.
*   Authors to address feedback and update drafts accordingly.
*   WG to decide on adoption for the SR Policy End Node SID Optimization draft.
*   Address rechartering concerns.
*   Resume presentations on Friday.
