## Summary

The LAMPS working group meeting covered several active documents, including CSR attestation, attestation freshness, CRL key usage validation, related certificate descriptors, and a new CA security tag. The group also discussed a draft for EST certificate renewal recommendations. Discussions focused on refining document content, addressing feedback, and ensuring practical implementability. A significant portion of the session was dedicated to debating the "hint" field within the CSR attestation document, revealing differing perspectives on its necessity and specificity.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **CSR Attestation:**
    *   Addition of an optional 'certs' field to the attestation result payload to match the evidence payload structure.
    *   Debate over the necessity and format of the "hint" field within the EvidenceStatement structure. Concerns raised about its vagueness, normative status, and impact on implementability.
    *   Discussion of whether the "hint" field should be a URL.
    *   Suggestion to move the "hint" field down into the contained evidence statement for container-based stuff.
    *   Concerns about the hint field being in every single evidence.
    *   Arguments about whether the existing optional hint field is optional, non-normative, or informative.
*   **Attestation Freshness:**
    *   Progress made in incorporating support for CMP, EST, and CMC protocols for nonce requests.
*   **CRL Key Usage Validation:**
    *   Discussion on the proposed fix for CRL key usage validation.
    *   Scope CRL issue certificate is Version 3 and that the key usage extension is present and verify that the CRLSign bit is set.
*   **Related Certificate Descriptors:**
    *   Overview of the draft, including support for certificate references and discovery purpose IDs.
*   **CA Security Tag:**
    *   Updates on the draft, including addressing security considerations and providing additional DNS record examples.

*   **EST Certificate Renewal Recommendation:**
    *   Presentation of a draft for an EST resource to query renewal information.
    *   Debate on why the CA knows the client's circumstances in what he asks for here is a CSR fixed for me.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **CSR Attestation:**
    *   Add the optional 'certs' field to the attestation result payload.
    *   Authors to add a reference in the document for attestation result.
    *   Authors to work through the WebAuthn example to assess the "hint" field usage and determine a way forward.
    *   Authors to modify the IANA registry table to provide both the oid and the name of the ASN1 structure that that OID belongs to.
    *   Retain in Working Group Last Call for the attribution at the attestation result.
*   **Attestation Freshness:**
    *   Merge the PR to have a fresh document version to look at.
    *   Drop a mail to the list asking for review once we got the other document under control and and then updated with the new content.
*   **CRL Key Usage Validation:**
    *   Wrap up the last call in the next week or so.
*   **Related Certificate Descriptors:**
    *   Seek feedback on the purpose IDs and the use cases for the draft.
*   **EST Certificate Renewal Recommendation:**
    *   Look at RFC 8295 to see if the problem is already solved.

## Next Steps

*   Continue discussions on the "hint" field in the CSR Attestation draft to reach a consensus.
*   Authors of various drafts to address feedback and prepare updated versions.
*   Request further reviews of the CRL Key Usage Validation draft.
*   Authors to implement the IANA registry table.
