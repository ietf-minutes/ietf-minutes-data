## Summary

The LAMPS working group meeting focused primarily on the composite signatures and KEMs drafts.  Significant time was spent discussing encoding formats, especially concerning the public and private keys. Decisions were made regarding the explicit inclusion of length tags in public keys and to proceed with a seed-only format for private keys.  The discussion then shifted to the encoding of the traditional part of the composite key, specifically whether to mandate a single encoding. The meeting concluded with a brief discussion of certificate status drafts, where concerns were raised about their necessity.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Composite Signatures and KEMs Updates:**
    *   Secret keys now use only seeds.
    *   Reference implementation is available, generating tables and test vectors.
    *   CMS-related sections have been removed from the core drafts to focus on core functionality.
    *   Additional composite combinations (MLDSA/RSA and ML-KEM/RSA) were added.
    *   The pure mode was removed, reducing the number of composite combinations from 30 to 17.
    *   Debate ensued regarding the inclusion of a randomizer ("R") in the signature value and its impact on determinism and perceived security.

*   **Randomizer Discussion:**
    *   Concern raised that the randomizer's presence might lead to unnecessary adoption elsewhere.
    *   Questioned whether the random number generation method provides any evidence for security gains.

*   **Binding the Composite Public Key:**
    *   Discussion on whether to bind the composite public key into the signature combiner.
    *   The idea was rejected due to potential problems related to the availability of the public key during message digest production.
    *   Suggestion of binding the OID instead was dismissed as the domain separator already serves that purpose.

*   **HKDF Combiner Changes (KEMs):**
    *   HKDF combiner was replaced with a direct HMAC construction for clarity and efficiency.
    *   SHA-384 was removed, relying solely on SHA-256 and SHA-512.
    *   Added length tag to the secret key.

*   **Traditional Public Key in Secret Key Format (KEMs):**
    *   Requirement for traditional public key to be present during decaps was identified.
    *   Decision to include the traditional public key in the secret key format.

*   **Encoding Discussion:**
    *   Debate about the encoding format, particularly whether to mandate a single encoding or allow existing options.
    *   HSM concerns raised re: need for software to perform lookup on component lengths.

*   **Private Key Encoding (Seed vs. Expanded):**
    *   Discussion on whether to support only seeds or also expanded keys in the private key format.
    *   Concerns were raised about HSMs not supporting seeds and the need for interop with them.

*   **Traditional Part Encoding:**
    *   Discussion on whether to pick a single encoding for the traditional part of the composite key.

*   **Certificate Status Drafts:**
    *   Discussion of a draft updating references in RFC 5280 for certificate status information, with concerns about its necessity.
    *   A second draft on digital certificate guidelines for web servers was briefly presented.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Public Key Encoding:** Adopt explicit length tags. Authors to grab version 4.
*   **Private Key Encoding:** Proceed with the seed-only private key format.
*   **Traditional Public Key in Secret Key:** Take the discussion of including or not including the traditional public key in secret key to the mailing list.
*   **Encoding Format:** Authors will pick a single format for public keys; take discussion to the mailing list to decide which one.
*   **Single Format Selection:** For the traditional private key, the document authors have free rein, with input from the mailing list to follow.
*   **Tighten Combiner Section:** Authors to tighten up the combiner section regarding converting keys to format before hashing it.
*   **Call for Adoption (Working Group Last Call):** Once the authors make the agreed upon changes, working group will proceed with call for working group last call.

## Next Steps

*   Authors will implement the decisions made during the meeting and publish an updated draft.
*   Further discussion on the remaining open issues will continue on the mailing list.
*   The working group will proceed with a call for working group last call on the updated drafts.
