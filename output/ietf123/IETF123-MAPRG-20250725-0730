## Summary

The Measurement Analysis for Protocols Research Group (maprg) meeting featured six presentations on various measurement studies related to network protocols, including Starlink performance, Anycast routing, and QUIC implementation. The discussions covered performance metrics, measurement methodologies, and potential optimizations.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Starlink Performance:** Analysis of latency and packet loss in Starlink networks, revealing geographical variations and temporal trends. Ground station placement and user numbers were considered as contributing factors. The discussion highlighted the black-box nature of Starlink and the need for further investigation into its internal workings. Ping measurements showing packet loss were debated for their representativeness of overall traffic.
*   **Starlink Content Delivery:** Examination of content delivery over Starlink, focusing on the interaction between terrestrial CDNs and LEO networks. Inconsistencies in ground infrastructure and satellite deployment were identified as potential sources of performance variations. A proposal for space-based CDNs was mentioned.
*   **Anycast Routing Measurement:** Presentation of a tool for measuring Anycast RTTs and inferring optimal routing paths. The tool combines catchment analysis with unicast probing to identify suboptimal routing and potential performance improvements.
*   **QUIC Handshake Optimization (Instant Acknowledgement):** Investigation into the impact of instant acknowledgements on QUIC connection performance. The results showed that instant acknowledgements can improve performance under certain conditions, but can also lead to worse performance in the presence of packet loss. Real-world CDN deployment of this optimization was also presented.
*   **QUIC Performance Comparison:** Comparative analysis of QUIC performance with and without HTTP. The results revealed significant differences in throughput and CPU utilization depending on the QUIC implementation, HTTP version, and traffic generator. Offloading features were also found to have a significant impact on performance.
*   **QUIC Pacing Strategies:** Study of the pacing behavior of different QUIC implementations. The results showed significant variations in inter-packet gaps and burst lengths. A kernel patch was proposed to improve pacing when using Generic Segmentation Offload (GSO). The ideal pacing strategy in wired vs. wireless networks was debated.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Hackathon Champion:** The group is seeking a champion to participate in the hackathon in Montreal in November.
*   **Tool Availability:** The Anycast RTT measurement tool is available upon request with the intention of making it public this year.
*   **QUIC Implementers Feedback:** Encourage future speakers to reach out to implementers when researching protocol implementations.
*   **Future Presentations:** Encourage community to present data produced from the Anycast RTT measurement tool at future sessions.

## Next Steps

*   Further investigation into Starlink performance variations, including the impact of ground station placement, user numbers, and technology changes.
*   Continued development and evaluation of content delivery strategies for LEO networks, including the space-based CDN proposal.
*   Public release of the Anycast RTT measurement tool.
*   Further research into QUIC implementation performance, including the impact of different congestion control algorithms, traffic generators, and hardware offloading features.
*   Explore collaboration opportunities to improve the proposed Kernel patch to improve QUIC pacing.
