# moq

## Summary

The meeting covered several important topics, including a discussion on whether to rename the "media over quick" protocol, updates to the moq-transport draft, the introduction of Privacy Pass tokens for enhanced security, a proposal for distributing Open Cybersecurity Framework (OCSF) events over MoQ, and an update on secure objects. Key technical discussions and decisions revolved around the handling of header extensions in secure objects, the possibility of self-subscription, and error handling for fetch requests.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Protocol Naming:** A vote was held regarding renaming the "media over quick" protocol. The majority favored keeping the current name, but the topic will be revisited on the mailing list.
*   **moq-transport Updates:** Alan presented updates to the moq-transport draft since IETF 122, focusing on new features, wire changes, and compression schemes. Changes included request IDs, authentication info structure, forward flags, and joining fetch.
*   **Privacy Pass Tokens:** Cullen introduced Privacy Pass tokens as an alternative to CAT tokens, designed to provide privacy-preserving authorization. The discussion covered the scope of authorization and the need for consistency with CAT tokens.
*   **OCSF over MoQ:** Suhas proposed using MoQ to distribute Open Cybersecurity Framework (OCSF) events for cybersecurity applications, emphasizing its potential to reduce latency and improve scalability compared to traditional systems. The discussion revolved around use cases and the applicability of MoQ's charter.
*   **Secure Objects:** Cullen updated the group on secure objects, focusing on the handling of header extensions. The proposal involves categories of header extensions that relays can modify, see but not modify, or cannot see (encrypted). There was debate on mutability and placement of the integrity marker.
*   **Self-Subscription:** A debate occurred about allowing a publisher to subscribe to its own track. Concerns revolved around potential loop issues. The preliminary conclusion was to allow it, enabling multi-publisher scenarios.
*   **Fetch Range Errors:** The group discussed how to handle fetch requests for ranges that are too large. The initial idea of providing an explicit fetch error for too-large requests was favored over more complex approaches like subsetting the fetch.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Protocol Naming:** Stick with the current name "media over quick" but revisit the discussion on the mailing list.
*   **Privacy Pass Tokens:** Further discussion of Privacy Pass tokens on the mailing list, followed by potential adoption call.
*   **Secure Objects:** Take the discussion of header extensions and integrity markers to the mailing list for further consideration.
*   **Fetch Range Errors:** Add an explicit fetch error for requests with a range that is too large.

## Next Steps

*   Magnus and the chairs will coordinate on adoption calls for Privacy Pass tokens and CAT tokens after mailing list discussion.
*   Further discussions will take place on the mailing list regarding header extensions in secure objects, including mutability and integrity marker placement.
*   A PR will be written to add an explicit fetch error code.
*   The implementation of a PR that allows the feature of self-subscription in moq should include clarification about whether the publisher also receives their own objects when subscribed to the same namespace and track.
