## Summary

The NETCONF working group meeting at IETF 123 covered several topics, including updates on drafts related to NETCONF over QUIC, YANG groupings, YANG push notifications, private candidates, and the YANG library.  There were also discussions about unchartered items such as YANG push light and a SEABOR encoding draft. The meeting included polls to gauge working group consensus on key design decisions.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Netconf over QUIC:**  Concerns about zero RTT replay attacks and clarifications on call home implications were addressed.  The draft is converging and may be ready for working group last call after another pass.
*   **YANG Groupings for QUIC Clients and Servers:** The draft defines reusable YANG groupings for the QUIC protocol. The main issue revolves around how to represent IANA registry values (Quick versions, Quick transport parameters) in YANG enums when they are in hexadecimal format. Use of identities versus enums was discussed, with Kent suggesting enums unless inheritance is needed. Mark Glacier raised a need for non-standard parameters for deep space applications.
*   **Extensible YANG Model for YANG Push Notifications:** The discussion focused on the configuration switch for enabling/disabling the extensible YANG model. The group ultimately favored a global switch over per-subscription or per-collector switches to simplify deployment.  A poll confirmed the working group's preference for a global switch.
*   **NetConf and RESTConf Private Candidates:** Discussion covered implicit deletion behavior with `when` conditions.  There was debate on whether deletion should be treated as a conflict, and whether updates to running configuration are brought into private candidates.
*   **Augmented By Addition to the YANG Library:** A key limitation was discussed: the restriction that augmented-by can only list modules within the same module set. Rob Wilton emphasized this limitation and its impact on module set unions. The group agreed to highlight this limitation more prominently in the draft, particularly in the introduction.
*   **Yang Push Light:**  This draft aims to simplify Yang Push and align with gNMI. Discussions included alignment between dynamic/configured subscriptions, decomposed subscriptions, and the potential for splitting the configuration model (and possibly RPC model) into a separate draft.
*   **Seabor Encoding for HTTP-Based Transports for Yang Notifications:** The draft proposes adding SEABOR encoding support to the HTTPS Notif draft. Performance analysis showed increased throughput in low bandwidth networks. The group showed interest in working on this document.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Netconf over QUIC:** Authors to make another pass at the draft, addressing concerns and preparing for a possible working group last call.
*   **YANG Groupings for QUIC Clients and Servers:**  Authors to consider using identities instead of enums and addressing the representation of IANA registry values.
*   **Extensible YANG Model for YANG Push Notifications:** Authors to proceed with a global configuration switch for enabling the extensible YANG model. The chairs will take the request for working group last call to the mailing list.
*   **NetConf and RESTConf Private Candidates:** Authors will publish version 08 to rework introductory sections and clarify text on implicit deletion.  The group aims to conclude last call and move towards publication.
*   **Augmented By Addition to the YANG Library:** Authors to stress the limitation of augmented-by in the introduction of the document.
*   **Yang Push Light:** The group did not reach a consensus on splitting the yang modules in the draft to a seperate document.
*   **Seabor Encoding for HTTP-Based Transports for Yang Notifications:** Take to the mailing list, but there seemed to be enough interest in adopting this draft, continue the work.

## Next Steps

*   Authors to address feedback received during the meeting and update their respective drafts.
*   The working group chairs will assess the readiness of documents for working group last call and initiate the process as appropriate.
*   Continue discussion of unresolved issues on the mailing list.
*   Mahesh will present on moving YANG models outside of documents in the Ops Area working group. Rob may volunteer to be an experiment.
