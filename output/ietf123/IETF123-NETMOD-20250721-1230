## Summary
The NETMOD working group meeting at IETF 123 in Madrid covered document updates, versioning requirements, YANG packages, YANG configuration templates, validating context under anydata, and a proposal for handling deprecations and obsolescence in YANG models. The meeting included presentations, discussions, and polls to gauge working group interest in specific problem areas.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Document Updates:** Several documents have advanced in the RFC process, including the YANG syslog model, and updates related to versioning.
*   **Versioning Requirements:** Discussion on maintaining a current document outlining the requirements for YANG versioning.
*   **YANG Packages:** Review of YANG packages structure, hierarchy, and tooling, with a focus on simplifying and clarifying the draft document. Specific points included module tags, schema mounts, automatic resolution of module versions, excluding modules, and the definition of implementing a package.
*   **YANG Configuration Templates:** Introduction of a new internet draft proposing a templating solution for data stores with similar configuration subtrees, including the application of templates and precedence rules.
*   **Validating Context Under Anydata:** Discussion on how to validate data under `anydata` using the YANG library, particularly in the context of YANG push.
*   **Handling Deprecations:** A proposal for addressing the issue of unreadable machine code when deprecations are handled.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Interface V-Lan Model & Interface Extensions:** Scott and Rob will update the drafts after this IETF meeting.
*   **Versioning Requirements:** Keep the versioning requirements draft active.
*   **YANG Packages:** Continue progressing with the package work and document updates; progress on the package compiler.
*   **YANG Configuration Templates:** Review the design on configuration templates and their application with edit config; to review the metadata mechanism. Mail the list on key points.
*   **Validating Anydata:** Define the problem to be solved more clearly, solution to follow.
*   **Handling Deprecations:** Investigate solutions and report findings back to the working group.

## Next Steps

*   Authors to address comments and suggestions from the working group on their respective drafts.
*   Discussions on the mailing list to clarify key concepts and address open issues.
*   Further development and testing of YANG package tooling.
*   Potential for additional interim meetings to progress work.
*   The next step for validation anydata would be to have an individual draft that specifically identifies the problem.
