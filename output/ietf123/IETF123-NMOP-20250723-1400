# nmop

## Summary
This NMOP session included presentations on validating configure subscription yang push publication, the open source project Anomali lifecycle and semantics, and the CEMAP hackathon results.  An update was also given from the design team on knowledge graph.  Open mic time focused on coordination between working groups and locations for young models.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Validating Configure Subscription Yang Push Publication:**  Thomas presented on hackathon activities validating Yang Push implementations, including extending Lib-Yang for any data validation and validating the message broker telemetry message schema. Key findings included gaps in Lib-Yang related to data store mapping and Yang Structures support.
*   **Open Source Net Anomaly Lifecycle and Semantics:** Vincenzo presented on Antagonist, an open-source project used to validate network anomaly detection drafts.  The presentation covered moving towards a production-ready version, a new UI, and validation with Swisscom data. The discussion focused on data model scalability and the refinement process. There was question and answer regarding the backend.
*   **CEMAP Hackathon Results:** Pierre François reported on the CEMAP hackathon, focusing on modeling VPN services steered into SRV6 routes. An implementation of the Vivex draft on modeling external relationships was used.  The discussion included feedback on SRV6 models and adaptation of code.
*   **Knowledge Graph Update:** Michael gave an update from the knowledge graph design team, focusing on unifying the work of the three related drafts. The goal is to unlock connections between isolated data sources using semantic web ideas.  The team will create an initial POC fusing early CMAP bottle and examined the Noria ontology. Discussion included scalability, the formality of the IETF process, and use cases for anomaly and incident management.
*   **Any Data Discussion:**  The chair noted the any data implementation and questioned where there would be any testing. It was revealed that work has begun and a pull request on liby is available.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Knowledge Graph Design Team:** Those interested in joining the knowledge graph design team should contact the chair.
*   **SRV6 Topology Coordination:** The SRV6 ops chair, Olga, and Pierre Francois will collaborate on coordinating SRV6 topology modeling and alignment between CMAP and SRV6 ops.

## Next Steps

*   **Yang Push Validation:**  Address identified gaps in Lib-Yang related to data store mapping and Yang Structures support.
*   **Anomali Lifecycle and Semantics:** Finish backend implementation for the GUI and complete testing.
*   **CEMAP:**  Seek feedback on SRV6 models and adapt the code accordingly. Publish SRV6 models
*   **Knowledge Graph:**  Create initial POC using early CMAP model and examine the Noria ontology.
