## Summary

This meeting covered a variety of topics including token status lists, back-end tested client authentication, transaction tokens, client authentication with Spiffy, refresh token expiration, native app authentication, client extension claims, and deferred key binding. Several decisions were made regarding next steps for these drafts.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Token Status List:** The draft is in shepherd review and guidance is sought to speed up the process.
*   **Back-End Tested Client Authentication:** Discussions focused on the challenges with the challenge endpoint and potential optimizations for Depop usage, including potentially reusing the Deepop proof for client attestation.
*   **Transaction Tokens:** The draft is considered ready for working group last call after addressing concerns regarding HTTP header format.
*   **Client Authentication with Spiffy:**  Discussion centered on the use of ISS claims and the possibility of relaxing requirements when profiling documents.  Concerns were raised about supporting both Jot and X.509 ASWIT in the same draft.
*   **Refresh Token Expiration:**  Questions raised regarding defining parameters for clients to request time-limited tokens and the use of "expires in" vs. "expires at."
*   **Native App Authentication:** Addressing seamless native app authentication across trust domains. Browserless app to app communication.
*   **Client Extension Claims:**  Adding custom claims to be able to be used by different authentication requirements. Fire, FAPI etc.
*   **Pushed Client Registration**: Client IDs limitations were discussed as a whole. Ephemeral clients, SPA clients and client metadata fetch documents.
*   **Deferred Key Binding:** Exploring options on how to handle binding tokens to keys where proof-of-possession is deferred to a later stage and potentially done by a different entity. Different use cases were presented from different implementations.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Token Status List:** Proceed with shepherd review. Chairs to look into speeding the review process.
*   **Back-End Tested Client Authentication:** Authors to consider security analysis of Depop optimization and potential inclusion of a Deepop nonce in the challenge endpoint response. Andrew, Philip, and Aaron volunteered to review the document.
*   **Transaction Tokens:**  Start working group last call.
*   **Client Authentication with Spiffy:** Authors to create an issue regarding ISS claims. Working group to decide whether to split the draft into separate profiles for Jot and X.509 ASWIT.
*   **Refresh Token Expiration:** Address concept of granting vs. consent. Rename parameters.
*   **Pushed Client Registration:** Discuss what can be done with client registration and see if an interim meeting is possible to try to unite all solutions into the same area.
*   **Deferred Key Binding:** Create a thread on the mailing list to discuss the next steps of the draft and gather feedback from the group.

## Next Steps

*   Continue working on drafts based on feedback.
*   Schedule interim meeting to discuss approaches to identity and push client registration.
*   Shepherd reviews to be completed.
*   Working group last calls to be initiated.
*   Discuss deferred key binding and if protocols or BCPs needs to be followed.
