## Summary
The opsawg meeting at IETF 123 covered several topics including updates on OAM characterization, cozy signatures for Yang data provenance, packet discard reporting, network diagnosis, OAM test scheduling, SRv6 path segment identification, and IPFix export of GPON encapsulation. A significant discussion revolved around evolving the Yang development process within the IETF and moving Yang models outside RFCs.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **OAM Characterization:** Discussion focused on clarifying the terms "in-band" and "out-of-band" for OAM, emphasizing the importance of equal forwarding treatment for OAM and distinguishing between different methods (active, passive, hybrid).
*   **Cozy Signatures for Yang Data Provenance:** Updates on the draft included discussions on application scenarios, clarification on processing provenance signatures, updates to the Yang Push notification envelopes, and the completion of Yang modules.
*   **Packet Discard Reporting:** The discussion centered on the inadequacies of current packet discard reporting mechanisms, with a focus on ambiguous definitions and inconsistent implementations. The presentation addressed the information model, data model, and implementations across different vendors. Discussion if the work should be decoupled from IPFIX.
*   **Scheduled Sequences of OAM Tests:** The presentation updated the draft scope, focusing on managing OEM tests (creation, scheduling, status) on an SDN controller.
*   **SRv6 Path Segment Identification:** The importance of SRv6 path segment identification was discussed, especially related to the existing segment list. Adoption was supported and will continue to the mailing list.
*   **IPFix Export of GPON Encapsulation:** It introduced the GPON encapsulation and provided visibility in the ODL. The two IPFix entities for chain port will be proposed.
*   **Evolving Yang Development Process:** A broad discussion focused on moving Yang models outside of RFCs, the challenges of maintaining and updating these models, and streamlining the development and review process. Points raised included using Git repositories, automating tree diagram generation, and decoupling the Yang modules from the RFC update cycle.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **PCAP Draft:** Encourage review and feedback on the PCAP draft, which is in working group last call until early August.
*   **SRv6 Path Segment Identification:** Conduct a poll to determine if the draft should be adopted.
*   **IPFix Export of GPON Encapsulation:** Will check with Scott and see what the protocol is on IP-FIX to have a liaison for definitions.
*   **Yang Model Repository:** Will identify volunteers that want to run through this experiment with whatever modifications we agree here.
*   **Information the Liaison to study group 15:** Needed for using IP-FIX
*   **Contact the Broadham Forum:** To find out the forum's views on GPON encapsulation.

## Next Steps

*   **OAM Characterization:** A new revision of the draft will be created based on feedback received in the meeting and at IPPM.
*   **Cozy Signatures:** Prepare for a big Yang review after internal consistency checks. Address multiple signatories.
*   **Packet Discard Reporting:** John will request the Yang Doctor review now.
*   **SRv6 Path Segment Identification and IPFix Export of GPON Encapsulation:** Take the drafts to the mailing list for adoption discussion and a working group vote.
*   **Yang Development Process:** Discuss the proposal of moving Yang models outside of RFCs on the opsawg mailing list. Identify volunteers that want to run through this experiment.
