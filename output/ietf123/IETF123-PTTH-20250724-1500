# ptth

## Summary
The Potato Boff session explored the potential standardization of reverse HTTP (PtTH).  Presenters outlined various use cases including CDN origin communication, zero-trust network access, and more flexible proxy configurations. The session discussed the scope of standardization, ranging from a minimal HTTP role reversal to a broader "new waist of the internet" approach. The audience expressed significant interest in pursuing this work within the IETF, with a general preference for starting with a tightly scoped charter, potentially focusing on CDN use cases, while considering broader architectural implications. A new mailing list will be created and a charter drafted for further discussion.

## Key Discussion Points
*   **Terminology:** Agreement on the term "worker" to describe the HTTP server instance that processes client requests in PtTH scenarios.
*   **Use Cases:**
    *   Simplifying CDN origin communication by eliminating the need for manual firewall configuration.
    *   Enabling autonomous scaling and load balancing by allowing workers to dynamically connect to CDNs.
    *   Fine-grained prioritization and improved handling of heavyweight requests.
    *   Zero-trust network access without traditional VPNs.
    *   Remote administration of workstations without requiring inbound connectivity.
    *   Providing workers with more control over proxy configuration.
*   **Scope:**
    *   Divergent views on the scope of the work, ranging from simple HTTP role reversal to a broader "new waist of the internet" approach encompassing diverse protocols.
    *   Focus on starting with the CDN use case as a manageable starting point.
    *   The inclusion of "origin slicing" (selective request forwarding) was debated, with some advocating for exclusion from the initial scope.
*   **Security:**  Emphasis on addressing security implications, particularly regarding authorization and the distribution of configuration privileges to workers.
*   **HTTP as the Right Layer:**  Discussion of whether HTTP is the appropriate foundation for PtTH, considering alternative approaches for generic transport.  The argument for HTTP centered on its widespread deployment, existing infrastructure, and successful extensibility.
*   **Interoperability:**  Need for cross-vendor interoperability to standardize what Cloudflare, Zscaler and others are doing.
*   **Working Group vs. Existing Group:** Debate on the optimal venue for this work, with the HTTP working group and a new working group being discussed. Consensus trended toward forming a new working group, but not conclusive.

## Decisions and Action Items
*   **Decision:**  Create a dedicated mailing list for discussing PtTH standardization.
*   **Action Item:**  Chairs (Hannes and David) will establish the new mailing list and announce it on the HTTP mailing list.
*   **Action Item:** Interested parties will draft a charter, considering a tightly scoped approach initially, focusing on the CDN use case but with consideration for architecture implications of that in the future.

## Next Steps
*   Formation of the PtTH mailing list.
*   Charter drafting process to define the scope of the work.
*   Potential Boff session or a working group forming Boff at a future IETF meeting.
