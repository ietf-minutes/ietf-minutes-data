## Summary

The RASPRG session covered three presentations. First, Jeffrey Ding presented research on US-China economic interdependence in standards setting. Second, Brian Newbold discussed interoperation in the AT protocol ecosystem. Finally, Karim Atumani Muhammad presented on quantifying barriers to African participation in IETF standardization.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **US-China Interdependence:**
    *   Jeffrey Ding presented data suggesting economic interdependence between the US and China in IETF standards is increasing, despite narratives of decoupling.
    *   Discussion centered on whether RFC co-authorship accurately reflects economic relationships and investment in global interoperable standards.
    *   Suggestions were made to consider deployment and adoption of standards as additional indicators of interdependence.
    *   The relevance of Chinese national policies on standardization was discussed.
*   **AT Protocol Ecosystem:**
    *   Brian Newbold discussed Blue Sky's efforts to standardize the AT protocol, including considerations for venue (IETF, W3C, or a new foundation).
    *   Challenges in balancing product development with protocol standardization were highlighted.
    *   Concerns about maintaining credible neutrality and avoiding corporate dominance in the ecosystem were raised.
    *   The need for expertise in security, extensibility, and protocol evolution within a standards body was noted.
*   **African Participation in IETF:**
    *   Karim Atumani Muhammad presented on barriers to African participation in the IETF, including geographic, linguistic, and structural challenges.
    *   Proposals were made to track regional participation statistics, translate documentation, and promote author diversity.
    *   The importance of engaging with African academia and youth communities was emphasized.
    *   The economics of participation and the need for funding and career pathways were discussed.
    *   The role of industry engagement in driving standards development and deployment was highlighted.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Jeffrey Ding:** Consider incorporating deployment/adoption data and exploring country-specific trends in network analysis. Talk to people and figure out why people become co-authors, for a good understanding of the topic.
*   **Brian Newbold:** No specific action items, but the presentation served as a valuable exploration of the challenges and considerations involved in standardizing a rapidly evolving protocol ecosystem.
*   **Karim Atumani Muhammad:** Continue work on the internet draft outlining barriers to African participation and strategies for improvement.

## Next Steps

*   Encourage further discussion and collaboration on the topics presented in the RASPRG mailing list and at future meetings.
*   RASPRG to consider future research on participation statistics and inclusive outreach.
