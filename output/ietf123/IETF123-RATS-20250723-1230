## Summary

The RATS working group meeting covered three presentations: an update on the COSE Reference Integrity Manifest (CORIM) draft, an update on the Reference Interaction Models draft, and a new draft proposing key negotiation integrated into remote attestation. A call for adoption was made for the COServe draft. Discussions focused on the readiness of documents for working group last call, the relationship between different drafts and their alignment with the RATS architecture, and the scope of the RATS charter regarding protocol specifications.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **CORIM Update:**
    *   Discussion on early adopters and their relationships (e.g., AMD, Google, Intel, Oracle). It was agreed to take this discussion to the mailing list.
    *   Request for more reviews of the CORIM draft before working group last call.
    *   Clarification that outstanding review comments need to be addressed before proceeding to working group last call.
*   **Reference Interaction Models:**
    *   Progress on incorporating feedback from Usama.
    *   Remaining 20% of feedback requires further discussion and consensus-building.
    *   Goal to achieve working group last call in six to eight weeks.
*   **Key Negotiation Integrated into Remote Attestation:**
    *   Suggestion to connect with the confidential container community regarding their keybroker service and protocol.
    *   Need for clarification on how much protocol work falls within the RATS charter.
    *   Discussion on the overlap with the lake working group's draft on attestation over ad hoc protocol.
    *   Distinction between attesting the trustworthiness of a stakeholder in key negotiation versus using established trustworthiness to perform key negotiation.
*   **COServe:**
    *   Call for adoption of the COServe draft.
    *   Requests for a diagram illustrating the connection between COServe and other RATS documents (e.g., multi-verifier graph, posture assessment draft) and its mapping to the RATS architecture.
    *   Clarification of the scope of COServe as pertaining to the endorsement and reference value side (supply chain to verifier).
    *   Discussion of the relationship between COServe and CORIM, with COServe adding query and pull capabilities to CORIM's assertive format.

## Decisions and Action Items
