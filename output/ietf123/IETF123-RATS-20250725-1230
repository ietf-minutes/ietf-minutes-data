## Summary

The RATS working group meeting covered a variety of topics related to remote attestation, including conceptual message wrappers, measured components, remote attestation over ad-hoc protocols, distributed remote attestation, posture assessment, extending trust path routing, evidence vs trusted self-assertions, remote attestation with multiple verifiers, and attested TLS. The meeting involved presentations, discussions, and requests for feedback on ongoing drafts.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Conceptual Message Wrappers (CMW):** Debate on the use of the term "authentication" within the CMW context, with concerns about potential misinterpretations and overlap with attestation provided by other protocols. The need for precise qualifiers when using "authentication" was highlighted.
*   **Eat Measured Component:** Request for working group last call.
*   **Remote Attestation over Ad Hoc:** Presentation on using ad hoc protocol with external authorization data (EAD) for IoT attestation, focusing on fast trust establishment and lightweight communication. Discussion on use cases and the practicality of applying remote attestation for device onboarding scenarios.
*   **Distributed Remote Attestation:** Proposal of a distributed ledger-based architecture for remote attestation involving multiple verifiers, addressing scalability and trust sharing concerns. Concerns were raised regarding increased complexity and the necessity of multiple verifiers compared to a single, trusted verifier.
*   **RATS Posture Assessment:** Introduction of a draft aiming to standardize claims for scalable remote posture assessment, using structured evidence and policy-aware verification. Discussions touched on the specific measurements to be conducted and the overlap with attestation protocols.
*   **Extending Trust Path Routing:** Presentation on extending trusted path routing to runtime behavior, evaluating trust based on threat exposure of devices. Challenges included diverse attestation models, efficiency, path-level assessment, and inter-domain interoperability.
*   **Evidence vs. Trusted Self Assertions:** Debate on terminology surrounding evidence in scenarios where devices provide assertions about themselves, with a focus on defining endorsed assertions.
*   **Remote Attestation with Multiple Verifiers:** Presentation and discussion on a draft concerning composite attestation. Concerns and support for adoption were voiced.
*   **PKI-Based Evidence for HSMs:** Introduction to using PKI based evidence for remote attestation of Hardware Security Modules. The discussion surrounded the information model and the proper terminology to use when discussing claims, measurements, and attributes.
*   **Proof of Residency Aware Location Claim:** Discussed adding trusted geolocation to attested claims.
*   **Proof of Position for Auditor Managed Endorsements:** Discussed getting a third party to attest for device characteristics.
*   **Attested TLS:** A summary of the discussed requirements for atTLS.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **CMW:** Resolve the "authentication" terminology issue offline and bring the resolution back to the mailing list.
*   **Eat Measured Component:** Solicit for doctor shepherd.
*   **Remote Attestation over Ad Hoc:** Provide technical comments to the lake list and keep RATS apprised of the last call.
*   **Remote Attestation with Multiple Verifiers:** Take the discussion to the mailing list and potentially hold an interim meeting for further discussion before calling for adoption.
*   **PKI-Based Evidence for HSMs:** Discuss nomenclature.
*   **atTLS:** Continue the discussion on the atTLS mailing list.

## Next Steps

*   Address comments from the meeting on respective drafts.
*   Continue discussions on mailing lists.
*   Schedule interim meetings as needed.
