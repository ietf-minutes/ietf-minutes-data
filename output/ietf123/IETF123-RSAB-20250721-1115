# RFC Series Approval Board

## Summary

This meeting focused on the approval process for two documents: an SVG document and an update to RFC 9280. Discussions covered the call for community comments process, handling of substantive and non-substantive comments, and the specific procedures required for updating RFC 9280, including IAB and IESG approval.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **SVG Document Call for Comments:** The board discussed the process for generating and sending out the call for community comments for the SVG document.  A new process was suggested where Cindy would draft a boilerplate message for Suresh to customize.
*   **Tooling and Transparency:** The desire for improved tooling and transparency within the Datatracker to streamline the approval process and reduce reliance on email workflows was discussed.
*   **RFC 9280 Update: Community Feedback Analysis:** Elliot, as the shepherd, presented an analysis of community feedback on the RFC 9280 update. Roman added additional feedback he observed from Ecker and Rob. Elliot will send a reformatted message to the RSWG chairs for consideration.
*   **Handling Substantive vs. Non-Substantive Comments:** The board discussed how to differentiate between substantive and non-substantive comments and how they should be handled by the RSWG. The RSWG chairs will indicate which comments have already been addressed.
*   **Potential for Relitigation:** Concerns were raised about the potential for relitigating previously discussed issues in the working group, especially regarding Section 7 of the document. The RSWG chairs will constrain any discussion to the specific points raised by the ARSAB.
*   **RFC 9280 Update: IAB/IESG Approval Process:**  The special procedure for updating RFC 9280, requiring specific approval from the IAB and IESG, was discussed.  The interpretation of the original document's wording regarding this approval was clarified: IAB/IESG approval acts as a hold before publication. The IAB and IESG will use their standard decision making processes and not ballots.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Action Item:** Cindy will draft a boilerplate message for future Call for Community Comments, which will then be customized by the document shepherd.
*   **Action Item:** Elliot will reformat the community feedback message for RFC 9280, clarifying the scope of discussion on Section 7, and send it to the RSWG chairs (Russ and Pete) by Wednesday.
*   **Decision:** The RSWG chairs (Russ and Pete) will review the community feedback message and determine how to address each issue in the working group, including indicating whether the issue has already been resolved and providing relevant pointers to RSWG discussions.
*   **Action Item:** IAB and IESG chairs to consider process for approving the RFC 9280 update.

## Next Steps

*   Elliot will send the community feedback message to RSWG chairs by Wednesday.
*   RSWG chairs will review the message and determine next steps for the working group.
*   The IAB and IESG will develop a plan for their respective approvals of the RFC 9280 update prior to publication.
