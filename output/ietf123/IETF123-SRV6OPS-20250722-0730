# srv6ops

## Summary

The SRV6 Operations (srv6ops) meeting in Madrid covered various aspects of SRV6 deployment and operation. Presentations included operator experiences from Deutsche Telekom, Iats (Brazil Internet Exchange), and MTS Web Services. Discussions focused on traffic engineering, migration strategies, and use cases in cloud and mobile networks. A white paper on SRV6 header compression (C-SID) was also presented. Several working group drafts were discussed, including a migration guide from IP/MPLS to SRV6, and SRV6 for end-to-end data centers and deterministic path placement in AI/ML backends.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Deutsche Telekom Traffic Engineering:**  Challenges in moving from MPLS to SRV6 traffic engineering, particularly the loss of MPLS forwarding counters. Investigating IPFIX data and SRV6 local counters for traffic matrix calculation.
*   **Iats (Brazil Internet Exchange) SRV6 Deployment:**  Successful migration from VPLS to EVPN using SRV6 data plane. Key benefits included simplified operation, fast convergence, and leveraging IPv6 flow label for load balancing.  Challenges included training internal teams and vendor support.
*   **MTS Web Services SRV6 in the Cloud:**  Using SRV6 for overlay networks in a greenfield public cloud deployment. Motivations included clear separation of underlay and overlay, programmability, and potential for end-to-end SRV6 paths.
*   **SRV6 Header Compression (C-SID) White Paper:**  Overview of RFC9800 and benefits of C-SID, including efficient carriage, high scalability, and smooth evolution. Discussion of deployment scenarios, visualization, traffic steering, and protection.
*   **Migration Guide Draft:**  Presentation of the updated migration guide draft, including different migration options (overlay, ships in the night, interworking).  Discussion about existing configuration leverage and potential limitations.
*   **SRV6 End-to-End Data Center Draft:**  Focus on using SRV6 to eliminate protocol translation between VXLAN and SR-MPLS. Flexible service insertion (e.g., firewalls) and traffic engineering were key benefits.
*   **SRV6 Deterministic Path Placement in AI/ML Backends Draft:**  Leveraging SRV6 for deterministic path placement to avoid collisions and improve job completion time in AI training workloads. Discussion of complexity on the NIC for congestion feedback loop.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Migration Guide Draft:**  Authors to update the draft based on feedback received, and the chairs will consider starting the adoption call after the update.

## Next Steps

*   Authors of the discussed drafts will incorporate the feedback and suggestions.
*   The working group will continue discussions on the mailing list.
*   Chairs to initiate adoption call for the Migration Guide draft after authors update it.
