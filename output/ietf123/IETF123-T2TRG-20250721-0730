# t2trg

## Summary

This meeting of the t2trg research group covered several key topics related to IoT security, smart buildings, and software updates. Presentations included discussions on the challenges of securing smart buildings, applying IETF IoT frameworks to energy edge applications, utilizing AI agents for IoT system management, and a novel method for secure software updates via group communication.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Smart Building Security and Evolvability:** Carolina presented research on making smart buildings more secure, resilient, and evolvable. The discussion focused on the limitations of current industrial and home automation approaches, the need for software freedom from hardware, and the business model and regulatory challenges of allowing user modifications to device software. The use of WebAssembly for containerization and security isolation was discussed. The cost and complexity of industrial control systems versus home automation solutions were also highlighted. Hannes and Kasten raised concerns about security implications of user modification.
*   **IETF IoT Frameworks for Energy Edge:** Greg presented on applying IETF IoT frameworks to secure communication at the energy edge, focusing on the unique requirements of utility environments. A key point was the skepticism of the power systems community towards communications-based solutions due to concerns about speed, reliability, and security.
*   **AI Agents for IoT Operations:** Jaime presented an implementation of an AI agent interacting with IoT devices, utilizing co-op for device communication. The agent uses natural language processing to interpret user intents and generate plans to interact with IoT devices. The demo showcased the agent's ability to discover devices, retrieve data, and modify device states based on user input.
*   **Software Updates with Group Communication:** Marco presented a draft for a secure and efficient method for distributing software updates to a fleet of IoT devices using co-op, blockwise transfer, and group OSCore. The discussion covered the architecture, processes for advertising and distributing updates, and security considerations, including the use of checksums to prevent tampering.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Document Status:** The "Taxonomy of Operational Security Considerations for Manufacturing instill keys and trust anchors" document is nearing research group last call. Chairs will review a final update.
*   **Document Status:** The "Guidance of rest of this for iot" document is pending chair review before last call.
*   **Document Adoption:** The research group is considering adopting documents on using only enrauding with co-op and distributed software updates with end-to-end secure group communication, blockwide transfer co-up.

## Next Steps

*   Finalize the two documents ("Taxonomy..." and "Guidance...") for research group last call.
*   Continue discussions on the mailing list and at interim meetings regarding smart building security, AI agent implementations, and secure software update mechanisms.
*   Further develop the "Software Updates with Group Communication" draft, including concrete examples, details on map key provisioning, and a comparison with existing recovery approaches.
