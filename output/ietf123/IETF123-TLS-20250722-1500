## Summary

This TLS working group meeting covered several key topics, including status updates on working group documents, adoption calls for new drafts, and discussions around post-quantum cryptography (PQC). A significant portion of the meeting focused on the transition to PQC, including dual certificates, hybrid key exchange, and ML-KEM only key agreement. The meeting also addressed extended key update, jumbo records and a potential applicability statement.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Working Group Document Status:** Several documents are nearing completion, including 8447 BIS, ECH drafts, and TLS 1.3 updates. Concerns regarding expired drafts and the need for author availability were raised.
*   **Adoption Calls:** Discussion on adoption calls for SLHDSA, composite MLDSA, dual certs, and MTLS flags. The working group will proceed with adoption calls with an awareness of address harvesting and the need for a hybrid approach.
*   **PQ Algorithm Considerations:** The need to decide whether PQ algorithms will be informational or standards track documents was highlighted, as well as the development of applicability statements and security considerations.
*   **Stephen's Catch Draft:**  A working group last call was considered, but delayed to incorporate community comments.
*   **Extended Key Update:** Discussion of forward secrecy vs post compromise security and simplification of conflict resolution and rejection of key updates.
*   **Jumbo Records:** Presentation on large record sizes for TLS and DTLS, including implementing variable length length field and new record type format.
*   **ML-KEM Only Key Agreement:** Updates on the draft, including removing unnecessary text and addressing concerns about failures.
*   **PAKE Authentication:** Presentation on TLS 1.3 PAKE authentication, with concerns on how to integrate with three-move PAKE integration.
*   **Dual Certificates:** Extensive discussion on the transition to PQC and the pros and cons of dual certificates versus composite certificates. The working group members have conflicting ideas and a consensus needs to be met.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Extended Key Update:** Work with FAT on proper text and address DTLS section to retransmissions.
*   **Jumbo Records:** Review, and implement variable length length field in a PR, then discuss on the list.
*   **PAKE Authentication:** Schedule an adoption call with the understanding that the content will be open to change after adoption.
*   **Dual Certificates:** Revisit on the mailing list.

## Next Steps

*   Authors to address action items, and implement suggested changes.
*   Continue discussions on PQC transition strategies on the mailing list.
*   Initiate adoption calls for drafts deemed ready.
