# tsvwg Meeting Minutes

## Summary

This meeting covered two main topics: an update on the FlowCube (FQPi) draft and a presentation on the DTLS over SCTP solution developed by a design team. The FQPi draft aims to standardize the FlowQueue-PI algorithm and initial feedback suggested readiness for adoption.  The DTLS over SCTP presentation detailed the proposed architecture and key management, aiming for a compromise between different approaches. Both the DTLS chunk and key management documents were received favorably for adoption as working group items.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **FQPi Draft:**
    *   The draft combines flow queuing with the PI algorithm, similar to FQ-CoDel, with a timestamp-based modification for queue delay calculation.
    *   Three implementations exist: Linux, FreeBSD, and NS3.
    *   The draft addresses a specification gap for FQPy compared to CoDel, FQ-CoDel and PI.
    *   The draft includes information on testing and deployment.
    *   Concern raised about potential impact of using timestamps to determine AQM action. The response addressed the Linux kernel implementation, which uses sojourn time calculation.
*   **DTLS over SCTP:**
    *   The proposed architecture includes a DTLS record protector and a DTLS chunk protector, functionally equivalent but with different payloads and parameters.
    *   Key management utilizes DTLS 1.3 with post-handshake authentication and TLS extended key update.
    *   The DTLS chunk aims to reuse existing record processing implementations.
    *   A new mechanism for downgrade protection is included, using protection solution indicators in key derivation.
    *   The DTLS chunk header is encrypted but not the SCTP common header.
    *   SCTP restart is supported using specific restart key material generated during the DTLS connection setup.
    *   Dependency on ongoing work in the TLS working group regarding extended key update.
    *   Discussion of IPR declaration and its impact on implementation.
    *   Presentation of the DTLS chunk and key management API.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **FQPi Draft:**
    *   The working group agreed to proceed with an adoption call on the mailing list.
*   **DTLS over SCTP:**
    *   The working group agreed to adopt both the DTLS chunk and the key management documents as working group items, pending confirmation on the mailing list.
    *   **Action Item:** Proponents (Magnus Westlund and Michael Tuexen) to draft a liaison statement to 3GPP, describing the progress and outlining the two documents, dependencies, and expected timeline.
    *   **Action Item:** Charles Eckel to handle liaisoning with the TLS working group regarding the extended key update draft.
    *   **Action Item:** Proponents to determine appropriate milestones for both documents.

## Next Steps

*   Confirmation of adoption for FQPi draft and DTLS over SCTP documents via the mailing list.
*   Drafting and sending the liaison statement to 3GPP.
*   Progressing the DTLS chunk document independent of the key management document, if possible.
*   Continued monitoring of the TLS working group's progress on the extended key update draft.
