# wish

## Summary
The WISH working group meeting focused primarily on the active working group document concerning server-sent offers. Discussions revolved around the appropriate HTTP status code to use when a server responds with a counter-offer (issue #12), lifetime of offers and multi-codec support. The group also considered the discoverability of WebRTC endpoints. Several action items were identified to progress the specification.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **HTTP Status Code for Counter-Offers:** The discussion centered around whether to use 202 (Accepted) when a server responds with a counter-offer to a client's offer. Concerns were raised that 202 might not be semantically correct. 303 (See Other) was suggested as an alternative, indicating a redirection to a new URL where the client should post its answer. 406 (Not Acceptable) was also briefly discussed.
*   **Offer Lifetime:** The group recognized the need to specify the lifetime of server-sent offers, preventing indefinite state on the server. Existing SFU behavior was mentioned as a potential starting point. Including an "expires" header in the response was suggested.
*   **Multi-Codec Support:** Sergio's proposal to mandate that clients offer all supported codecs was debated. Concerns were raised about bandwidth usage on mobile devices. A compromise of using a "SHOULD" recommendation was suggested, along with documenting reasons for not adhering to it.
*   **WebRTC Endpoint Discoverability:**  The group discussed the challenge of discovering WebRTC endpoints given a URL.  Options like URL schemes or a ".web" postfix were considered, but no consensus was reached.
*   **Service Sent Events:**  Agreement to move server-sent events to a separate extension document.
*  **Timeline**: Agreement that required items not addressed by the end of August will not go into V1. A potential interim meeting to address remaining issues.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Decision:** Replace the proposed 202 status code with 303 (See Other) for counter-offers.
*   **Action Item (Dan):** Update the pull request to use 303 (See Other) and document how to use it.
*   **Action Item (Dan):** Investigate options for specifying offer lifetime, potentially using an "expires" header.
*   **Action Item (Dan):** Add a "SHOULD" recommendation for clients to offer as many codecs as possible, including justifications for not doing so.
*   **Action Item (Chairs):** Revisit the discoverability issue on the mailing list and lean on HTTP experts.

## Next Steps

*   Dan to update the pull request with the agreed-upon changes and lifetime considerations.
*   Chairs to re-engage the mailing list regarding WebRTC endpoint discoverability.
*   Working group members to review the updated pull request.
*   Attempt to get all required items done with a PR by the end of August.
*   Consider an interim meeting in October to review progress.
