# CFRG Session Minutes - IETF 124

## Summary

The CFRG session focused on updates to adopted drafts, an introduction to newly adopted zero-knowledge related drafts, and efforts to revive several "expired" drafts critical for dependent work. Key discussions centered on incorporating significant performance improvements into the Verifiable Distributed Aggregation Functions (VDAFs) draft, moving the C-PACE draft to Research Group Last Call (RGLC), and addressing the long-standing issues preventing the progression of Pairing-Friendly Curves and BLS Signatures. A broader discussion also emerged regarding the need for a unified interface for elliptic curve definitions across various CFRG documents.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Chair Logistics and Mandate:**
    *   Welcome and logistics for the first of two CFRG sessions.
    *   Reminder of the IRTF Note Well (updated) and Code of Conduct (RFC 9775).
    *   CFRG's role is long-term research, providing advice and clarifying cryptographic primitives for IETF protocols, producing helpful documents.
    *   Today's agenda: adopted drafts, one new presentation. Thursday's session will focus on new presentations and hybrid CHEMs.
*   **Document Status Update:**
    *   **New RFCs since July:** Hash-based Signatures, KangarooTwelve, OPAQUE.
    *   Two drafts are in IRSG review; two are in Research Group Last Call (chairs to comment on list).
    *   **Newly Adopted Drafts:** Fiat-Shamir, Interactive Sigma Protocols, Sigma Protocols, Proust. These mark CFRG's entry into providing guidance on zero-knowledge primitives.
    *   Several active drafts have been updated; some expired adopted drafts are targeted for revival.
*   **Errata and Interim Meetings:**
    *   Four new errata reported, two closed. Community is encouraged to review and help close open errata.
    *   A successful interim meeting was held on Hybrid CHEMs, with follow-ups on the mailing list and further discussion planned for Thursday. The chairs are open to repeating this format for other thematic document groups.
*   **Zulip/Jabber Monitor Role:**
    *   It was requested that important points made in the active Zulip chat be flagged for repetition at the microphone to ensure wider awareness among attendees not actively monitoring the chat.
*   **Verifiable Distributed Aggregation Functions (VDAFs) Update (Christopher Patton):**
    *   The VDAFs draft defines a framework for lightweight multi-party computation solutions (VDAFs), initially motivated by privacy-preserving measurement use cases (browser telemetry, federated machine learning).
    *   It specifies two concrete VDAFs: PREO (general metrics using additive secret sharing and zero-knowledge proofs) and Poplar (heavy hitters using distributed point functions and arithmetic sketching).
    *   The draft has received extensive feedback and undergone a crypto review panel.
    *   **Two breaking changes proposed:**
        1.  **Improved Range Proofs:** A simple change aligning all range proofs in the specification, making them more general (arbitrary ranges at the same cost as power-of-two ranges) and improving SUM_VEC functionality. A Pull Request (PR) is available.
        2.  **Polynomial Evaluation in Lagrange Basis:** An optimization based on recent research (Armando Faz), significantly speeding up proof (50%+) and verification times by evaluating polynomials in the Lagrange basis using NTT.
    *   The question for the group was whether to incorporate these changes before Research Group Last Call, noting that adopters are willing to delay RGLC, but a crypto review panel re-review might be needed.
*   **C-PACE Update (Manuel Babusa):**
    *   The C-PACE draft has not seen significant changes since IETF 116 (Dublin).
    *   **Changes since Crypto Review Panel:** Removed network representation reference, added guidance for integration, included results from BairPAC papers (covering session ID calculation and UC security without pre-shared session IDs), added human-readable JSON test vectors, and a link to a reference implementation.
    *   Security analysis is now confirmed by two independent studies (game-based and UC-secure).
    *   The draft is considered stable and ready for progression.
*   **Pairing-Friendly Curves Update (Yumi Sakemi):**
    *   This draft, critical for advanced cryptographic primitives (BBS signatures, ZK-SNARKs), proposes recommended parameters. It was adopted in 2021 but stalled.
    *   **Problem:** The Kim et al. EX-attack (2016) reduced the security of curves like BN254, but legacy parameters are still in use. The goal is to provide updated, post-Kim's attack secure parameters.
    *   **Reason for stalling:** Disagreement on scope; authors desired a parameter-focused document, while reviewers sought a "textbook-level tutorial." Authors argue a tutorial belongs in a separate document.
    *   The draft is a bottleneck for other dependent drafts, like BBS signatures. Authors propose focusing on essential information for early RFC publication.
*   **BLS Signatures Update (John Sheffrin):**
    *   This draft is also being revived due to its widespread dependencies in initiatives like EU's EIDAS for privacy and scalability (competing with Google's Longfellow), and NIST's multi-party threshold cryptography efforts.
    *   A new version has been published with a reference to faster sub-checks for the BLS12-381 curve. John Sheffrin has joined as an editor.
    *   An interim meeting was suggested to collectively progress the entire stack of dependent documents (pairing-friendly curves, BLS signatures, JSON Web Proofs).
*   **General Elliptic Curve Interface Discussion:**
    *   Michele Marforio raised the issue of misalignment across various drafts (BBS, Hash-to-Curve, Ristretto, pairing curves) due to the lack of a unified interface for elliptic curve definitions. He proposed that CFRG should consider defining a common interface for fields, elliptic curves, and pairing-friendly elliptic curves to ensure future compatibility.
    *   Chris Patton noted that a de facto boilerplate API for prime order groups exists, but a formal draft could be useful.
    *   There was a mixed discussion on whether the pairing-friendly curves draft should be "parameters-only" or include more contextual information. Some (including Brent Zundell) argued for parameters only, while others suggested developers benefit from some context.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **VDAFs Draft:**
    *   **Decision:** The group will incorporate both proposed breaking changes (improved range proofs and polynomial evaluation in Lagrange basis) into the draft.
    *   **Action Item (Chairs):** Reach out to Julia (the previous crypto review panel reviewer) to request a review of the diff for the VDAFs draft.
    *   **Action Item (VDAFs Editors):** Integrate both changes and produce one more draft version before initiating Research Group Last Call.
*   **C-PACE Draft:**
    *   **Decision:** The chairs will proceed with issuing a Research Group Last Call (RGLC) for the C-PACE draft, as no remaining concerns were raised by the audience.
*   **BLS Signature Dependency Stack (Pairing-Friendly Curves, BLS Signatures, JSON Web Proofs):**
    *   **Action Item (John Sheffrin / Chairs):** Explore organizing an interim meeting to focus on progressing the entire stack of BLS-related dependent documents.
    *   **Action Item (CFRG Community):** Provide feedback on the CFRG mailing list regarding the desired scope of the Pairing-Friendly Curves draft (parameters-only vs. including more descriptive/tutorial content).
*   **Unified Elliptic Curve Interface:**
    *   **Action Item (CFRG Community):** Further discussion on the CFRG mailing list is encouraged to determine if and how CFRG should define a common, unified interface for elliptic curves and underlying fields across various documents.
*   **Key Representations (Offline):**
    *   **Action Item (Mike Jones & Yumi Sakemi):** Discuss key representations offline.

## Next Steps

*   The VDAFs draft will undergo final changes and a diff review before RGLC.
*   The C-PACE draft will enter Research Group Last Call.
*   Efforts to revive and progress the Pairing-Friendly Curves and BLS Signatures drafts will continue, potentially through a dedicated interim meeting.
*   Discussions on the need for a unified elliptic curve interface will proceed on the mailing list.
*   The next CFRG session, focusing on new presentations and hybrid CHEMs, is scheduled for Thursday.
