# DNSOP Working Group Meeting

## Summary

The DNSOP Working Group meeting addressed the status of several key drafts, including new RFC publications and documents in various stages of the IETF publication process. Significant discussions revolved around mandating IPv6 for DNS operations, improving Domain Control Validation mechanisms, formalizing the lifecycle of DNS cryptographic algorithms, and exploring hyper-local DNS deployments. The session concluded with a general call for working group members to review drafts and continue technical discussions on the mailing list, with specific follow-ups on forming small focus groups for certain drafts.

### Liaison/Dispatch Section (Friday)

*   Three drafts from the ISE track will be presented on Friday to determine if they fall within DNSOP's scope.

### Draft: "to R3901 abyss" (Mandating IPv6 for DNS Operations)

*   **Problem:** RFC 3901 (2004) allows IPv4-only for recursive resolvers and implicitly makes IPv6 optional for authoritative name servers. This leads to DNS fragmentation (up to 40% of zones are IPv4-only), preventing IPv6-only resolvers from reaching them. This contradicts RFC 6540 (2012), which states IPv6 support is no longer optional for IP nodes.
*   **Proposal:** Update RFC 3901 to mandate IPv6 for DNS, reflecting current widespread IPv6 deployment and improving DNS policy. Research suggests IPv6 DNS is ready, with most problems stemming from misconfigurations.
*   **Updates:** Incorporated fragmentation avoidance advice (RFC 9715), updated wording on IPv4/IPv6 translation, added more RFC references.
*   **Discussion:**
    *   Strong support for mandating IPv6, citing dropping IPv4 quality and the need for an RFC to encourage IPv6 adoption for authoritative DNS.
    *   **Editorial Feedback:** Suggested clarifying terms like "mapped addresses" (vs. synthesized) and adding references for Pref6 prefix selection.
    *   **Security Considerations:** Need to expand on security, especially regarding synthesized addresses and layer 2 security to prevent rogue arrays.
    *   **Stub Resolver Prioritization:** Debate on changing "should" to "may" for IPv6 prioritization (stub-to-recursive), with arguments that IPv4 is becoming "worse" and preferring IPv6 is desirable for persistent sessions and to avoid expensive keep-alives.
*   **Decision:** Chairs will initiate a Working Group Last Call (WGLC) after authors incorporate feedback, particularly on security and editorial points.

### Draft: "Domain Control Validation (DCV)"

*   **Updates (v-10):** Merged concepts of "unique tokens" (random tokens being an example), improved DNSSEC validation language, added a privacy consideration section, and began language cleanup.
*   **Open Issues:**
    *   **Threat Model:** Need a clearer threat model. Proposal to remove the 128-bit requirement for random tokens and encourage applications to select sizes based on their threat model.
        *   **Discussion:** Strong consensus that a formal threat model is essential. Speakers argued that the typical threat model is simple (seeing a token), requiring only enough bits to prevent accidental collision, while certificate signing may require higher security. Documenting trade-offs between token sizes was suggested over prescriptive musts. A formal threat model is seen as crucial for utility and avoiding "looking silly."
    *   **Multi-Account Section:** Reintroducing a trimmed version to support multiple intermediaries/accounts (e.g., two ACME validations in parallel).
        *   **Discussion:** Supported, as it's actively used in the field by ACME and other cloud-provider applications.
*   **Decision:** Chairs requested authors to include a comprehensive threat model and address minor comments for the next version. Once updated, it will be considered for WGLC.

### Draft: "DNS Integration in Application Environments"

*   **Goals:** Minimize conflicts between global DNS and applications, provide consistent user experience (unique identifiers), and extend DNS security/stability/resiliency.
*   **Updates (00 to 01):** Refined goals in abstract/introduction, narrowed intended audience to "applications providing DNS integrations," consolidated the "motivation" section, and made minor updates to existing considerations.
*   **Current Considerations:** Eight considerations (e.g., domain name lifecycle, stability, security, privacy) are outlined, with high-level challenges for applications not accounting for them.
*   **Next Steps:** Authors seek feedback on existing/new considerations and input on whether to adopt more normative/opinionated language (changing it from informational to potentially standards-track).
*   **Discussion:** Strong support for the document's necessity, with a call for the working group to thoroughly read and review it, given its adoption.
*   **Decision:** Working group members are urged to review the document and provide feedback on the mailing list.

### Draft: "Operational Accommodations for DS Automation"

*   **Updates:**
    *   Human notifications: Removed email suggestion; now states notifications should occur "according to established preferences" with the contract party.
    *   CDS/CDNSKEY checking: Removed recommendation for parents to check both records.
    *   DS configuration inspection: Domain owners "should" be able to inspect current DS configuration via a portal; update history is now "MAY" (due to registry concerns).
    *   DS automation disablement: Clarified that this should only happen if the DS record set was manually removed.
*   **Open Questions:**
    *   **Registry DS Automation without Registrar Interface:** Should registries perform DS automation if the registrar doesn't offer a DS removal interface?
        *   **Discussion:** Mixed opinions. Some argue registries should enable it (registrants can contact registry), others emphasize the complexity of registrar/registry communication and prefer an opt-in approach where registrars explicitly signal to registries.
    *   **Rescheduling DS Validation Checks:** Should the processing party (parent) reschedule acceptance checks later (e.g., after a week/month)?
        *   **Discussion:** General sentiment leans against this being the parent's responsibility if issues arise at the child's side later.
    *   **Appendix C:** Authors propose removing an appendix containing old ideas not reaching consensus unless there is feedback to keep it.
*   **Decision:** Discussion to continue on the mailing list.

### Draft: "Updating BCP 237 (DNSSEC Definition)"

*   **Purpose:** BCP 237 (RFC 8624) defines DNSSEC by listing core and related RFCs. This draft aims to update it, reflecting new RFCs, obsoleted documents, and especially the soon-to-be-published cryptographic algorithm recommendations (which are seen as highly actionable for implementers).
*   **Discussion:**
    *   **Desire for Updates:** General agreement that updating the list of relevant RFCs is useful, particularly for external readers.
    *   **Cadence:** Question about how often to update. Suggestions ranged from a fixed cadence (e.g., every two years) to updating around major milestones (e.g., DELIC deployment).
    *   **Mechanism:** Debate whether an RFC is the best mechanism (vs. a web page, IANA registry). RFCs provide findability and a historical snapshot, but frequent updates could be a burden. Other IETF protocols (IPSEC, SIP) rarely updated similar guides.
    *   **Working Group Time:** Concerns were raised about consuming WG time for repeated revisions, though the current draft is seen as relatively light review-wise.
*   **Decision:** Working group adoption is being considered. Further discussion on adoption and update cadence will happen on the mailing list.

### Draft: "Lifecycle of DNS Cryptographic Algorithms"

*   **Motivation:** Red Hat's removal of an older algorithm caused problems due to lack of clear, community-wide advice on sequencing the phasing in and phasing out of cryptographic algorithms.
*   **Proposal:** Defines a 7-phase lifecycle for DNS signing algorithms (Introduce, Mainstream, Phase Out, Deprecate, Remove) with criteria and transitions. Suggests an IETF-managed registry with expert consensus. Timeframes are measured in years/decades.
*   **Discussion:**
    *   **Scope:** Questioned if this should be specific to DNSSEC or a broader security area/CFRG concern.
    *   **DNS Specificity:** Arguments for DNS being special: no negotiation with resolvers, data is "at rest" (signed once, validated elsewhere), and expertise required is more about ecosystem knowledge than pure crypto research.
    *   **Announcement Mechanism:** Clarification sought on whether IETF "official announcements" occur via RFCs, IANA registry, or other means.
*   **Decision:** Discussion to continue on the mailing list. Chairs will follow up on potential call for adoption, considering the scope and suitable venue.

### Draft: "Hyper-local DNS"

*   **Motivation:** Update/replace informational RFC 8806 to encourage wider adoption of hyper-local root zone copies (local resolvers holding a copy of the root zone). Benefits include faster resolution, improved robustness, enhanced privacy, and reduced load on root servers.
*   **Proposal:** Seek Working Group adoption to elevate the document to a BCP (Best Common Practice) or Standards Track RFC to provide stronger incentive for implementation.
*   **Gaps:** Requires infrastructure for zone transfer (e.g., HTTP), content verification (ZoneMD), potential IANA/PTI oversight, and significant education/outreach.
*   **Discussion:**
    *   **Architectural Change:** Strong opposition to making it a BCP/Standards Track document, arguing it represents a fundamental architectural change to the DNS, which falls under IAB's purview, not DNSOP.
    *   **Root Server Load:** A root server operator clarified that current root server load isn't an issue; capacity exists for DDoS protection. The argument for DDoS defense-in-depth via hyper-local copies was noted but seen as orthogonal to routine load.
    *   **Evolution of Root Zone:** Concerns that widespread deployment could hinder future root zone evolution (e.g., adding new record types), as illustrated by issues with ZoneMD deployment in 2023.
    *   **Implementer Advice:** Need for more advice on monitoring and precautions against stale data.
    *   **Venue:** Suggestion to consider DNS-OARC or other operational groups, as this WG is "DNS operations" in name but doesn't focus on such operational guidance.
*   **Decision:** Discussion to continue on the mailing list, given the differing opinions.

### Drafts by Johan Stenstam: Dsync for Scanner/Notify Schemes & Dynamic Updates

*   **Draft 1: "DNSSEC Automation Signal for Scanners"**
    *   **Purpose:** Announce the existence and details of CDS/CDNSKEY scanners using the D-Sync record (`_dns-scanner` scheme) with additional info in an SVCB record (e.g., frequency, supported bootstrap mechanisms). Aims to set expectations for child operators.
    *   **Updates:** Moved scanner details into an SVCB record (was overloading D-Sync semantics). Added a mechanism for announcing support for multiple bootstrap methods.
*   **Draft 2: "Delegation Synchronization via Dynamic Updates"**
    *   **Purpose:** Revive and standardize the use of dynamic updates for automatic delegation synchronization from child to parent, leveraging the D-Sync record to specify the update target.
    *   **Bootstrapping:** Describes scalable mechanisms for automatically bootstrapping the child's `sig0` key in the parent, using either an 8078-like multiple vantage point approach or a 9615-like DNSSEC validation method.
    *   **Updates:** Aligned signaling of supported bootstrap mechanisms with the scanner/notify drafts, using SVCB records. Simplified EDNS-0 option communication by moving information to DNS records.
*   **Discussion:**
    *   **Interest:** A small number of attendees indicated interest in these drafts. The author highlighted that over 90% of children zones are unsigned, implying a large potential demand for such automation mechanisms.
    *   **Sig0 Bootstrapping:** Questioned the authentication mechanism for `sig0` keys (is it similar to DANE?). Author clarified it leverages DNSSEC validation for the public key.
    *   **Scalability:** Concern raised about the scalability of a mechanism where all resolvers get zone updates if it becomes default.
*   **Decision:** Chairs will consider organizing a small focus group to continue work on these drafts, alongside ongoing mailing list discussion.

### Draft: "DNS Transport Signaling (Opportunistic)"

*   **Motivation:** Provide explicit signals for alternative DNS transports (DoT, DoQ) beyond blind probing (RFC 9539), to allow for better distinction between test and production deployments, and signed validation.
*   **Proposal:**
    *   **Opportunistic Mode:** Use SVCB records in additional section of authoritative responses, providing an unvalidated signal.
    *   **Validated Mode:** Evolve towards an explicit query for an SVCB record, DNSSEC-signed, enabling expression of more complex (and potentially "dangerous") signals.
    *   **Example Signals:** `-DO53` to signal turning off UDP/TCP transport (useful for traffic separation, maintenance windows for unicast servers).
*   **Discussion:**
    *   **Support:** Seen as a good, short-term option that doesn't conflict with DELIC. Cloudflare expressed interest in implementation.
    *   **Opposition/Concerns:**
        *   **Inefficiency:** Increased packet size if SVCB records are always in the additional section.
        *   **Integration:** Difficult to integrate into the core delegation and resolution process compared to authenticated signals like DELIC.
        *   **Additional Section Abuse:** Historical concerns about "additional section" abuse in DNS. Preference for following the "regular, authenticated path."
        *   **Motivation for Implementation:** One implementer found it hard to justify implementing this alongside ongoing DELIC work, given the complexity on the resolver side.
*   **Decision:** Discussion to continue on the mailing list.
