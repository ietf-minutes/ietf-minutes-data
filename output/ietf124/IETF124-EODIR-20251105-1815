# EODIR

## Summary

This EODIR session provided updates and facilitated discussions on several key IETF operational areas. The primary topics included proposed revisions to the IETF Notewell and associated guidance for chairs, significant Datatracker tooling changes for working group adoption calls (which generated considerable community feedback and IESG apologies for process missteps), ongoing initiatives by the RFC Production Center (RPC) to streamline document processing and tools, and a major evolution in YANG module versioning rules to formally allow and track non-backwards compatible changes. Finally, a brief update was given on the revision of RFC 2418 concerning working group procedures.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **IETF Notewell Updates and Guidance**
    *   The goals for the new Notewell text were presented: emphasize behavior, use direct quotes, simplify language, merge lists, and replace BCP references with individual RFC references.
    *   ISG guidance instructs chairs to display the Notewell at the start of every session, preserve its text, and avoid creating additional policy slides.
    *   A short example script (30-60 seconds) was created for chairs to use, based on existing Notewell text, to ensure consistent messaging.
    *   Feedback included concerns about the Notewell's length and readability, particularly for non-native English speakers. Issues were raised regarding the practice of asking for affiliations at the microphone, potentially conflicting with the IETF's individual participation model, and perceived inconsistencies with RFC 8179 regarding IPR statements.
    *   As an interim measure, a large placard of the Notewell with a QR code linking to RFCs has been placed at registration.
    *   A sense of those present indicated a strong preference for a much shorter, reminder-focused Notewell presentation in meetings, as participants generally agree to IETF policies upon registration. However, it was noted that for interim meetings without a formal registration checkbox, the Notewell slide serves as the primary agreement reminder.

*   **Datatracker Tooling for Working Group Adoption Emails**
    *   Eric (IESG liaison) initiated this segment by apologizing for the lack of communication and explanation surrounding recent changes to the Datatracker's functionality for working group adoption calls. The intent behind the changes was to improve transparency and record these calls in the document history for IESG process review.
    *   Robert (tools team) acknowledged community feedback and identified problems with the initial implementation. A development branch has been deployed, featuring capabilities to preview and edit the adoption call message.
    *   Known issues include the need to edit content in three separate places and a bug where backing off an adoption call incorrectly leaves the document in a "candidate for adoption" state.
    *   **Significant concerns were raised by working group chairs**:
        *   The changes were perceived as imposing a mandatory formal call for adoption process, potentially altering established working group practices where documents might become WG documents by charter or chair judgment without such a formal call. Eric clarified the *intent was not to change the underlying process*, but to provide better tracking *if* a formal call is made.
        *   The IESG was strongly criticized for implementing tooling changes that impact working group chairs without prior consultation. Pete Resnick emphasized that the IESG does not *require* adoption calls to be tracked in the Datatracker and that such significant changes to chair workflows should involve community input *before* implementation.
        *   The IESG acknowledged the process misstep and apologized for not consulting the community ahead of time.

*   **RFC Production Center (RPC) Updates**
    *   Jean Mahoney (RPC Director) provided updates on several initiatives:
        *   **Author Intake Form**: A questionnaire for authors upon document submission has proven highly effective, with authors responding promptly (average 3 days, half within 1 day).
        *   **Cramdown RFC**: The RPC began accepting Cramdown RFC as an input format on September 1st, piloting with five documents per month.
        *   **Internal Tools and Q Management**: The RPC is updating its queue management system, incorporating internal version control using GitHub.
        *   **Optional GitHub for Auth48**: A pilot program is starting this month to allow authors to conduct the Author 48-hour review phase using GitHub. A single pull request with all RPC edits will be created in a new repository, although final approval will still be via email.
        *   **Publication Statistics**: The RPC has experienced a high volume, having published more documents this year than in all of 2023, with a significant influx in Q1 2024 (3200 pages, 74 documents). The RPC has 12 employees.
        *   **New Website Beta**: A beta version of the revamped RFC Editor website is available for review (requires Datatracker login), and feedback is encouraged.
    *   A question was raised regarding the archiving of GitHub discussions from the Auth48 process to ensure a resilient historical record, which the RPC will consider.

*   **YANG Module Versioning Evolution**
    *   Joe presented on behalf of the YANG community regarding significant evolutions to YANG module update rules, aiming to align with current practices and industry needs.
    *   **Key changes include**:
        *   Formally allowing non-backwards compatible (NBC) changes in YANG modules, while still encouraging their minimization.
        *   Designating changes in a YANG node's `status` to `obsolete` as an NBC change.
        *   Introducing new extension statements for YANG.
        *   Adding a new `rev-non-backwards-compatible` tag to the revision statement to explicitly mark NBC changes.
        *   Adopting a SemVer-like versioning scheme (e.g., 3.2.0) for YANG modules.
        *   Providing new guidance for selecting revisions for module imports.
        *   Introducing a new filename format incorporating the SemVer revision.
    *   These changes address the reality that NBC changes are already occurring in IETF and vendor modules, improving transparency for module users and facilitating more rapid YANG authoring.
    *   **Tooling Updates**: Plans are underway to update `pyang`, `rfcstrip`, and `libyang` to support these new rules. Much of this work is already complete. The updated tooling will be integrated into the Datatracker's existing YANG linting process.
    *   Three related Internet-Drafts are being held at the Auth48 phase pending the completion and deployment of these tooling updates.

*   **RFC 2418 Revision**
    *   Dave Thaler provided a brief update on the ongoing revision of RFC 2418, which details working group procedures. Dave Skunazi is leading this effort.
    *   Discussions are taking place on the `procon` mailing list and via GitHub. A recent meeting established guiding principles for differentiating between documented policy and common practices.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Notewell**:
    *   Feedback on the Notewell's length, readability, guidance on affiliations, and IPR consistency will be taken under advisement for future revisions.
    *   The use of physical Notewell placards with QR codes at registration will continue.
*   **Datatracker Tooling for WG Adoption Emails**:
    *   Robert and the tools team will address the identified issues (editing in multiple locations, "candidate for adoption" state bug) within the next 1-1.5 weeks.
    *   A community-wide review of the fixed development deployment will occur before general production rollout.
    *   The IESG will update the working group chair wiki with instructions and encourage the appropriate use of the new tooling.
*   **RFC Production Center**:
    *   The use of the author intake form and the Cramdown RFC pilot (5 documents/month) will continue.
    *   The pilot for optional GitHub for Auth48 will proceed as planned.
    *   The RPC will investigate mechanisms for archiving GitHub comments from the Auth48 process to ensure a robust historical record.
*   **YANG Module Versioning Evolution**:
    *   Non-backwards compatible changes in YANG modules are now formally permitted and will be explicitly marked using a new `rev-non-backwards-compatible` tag.
    *   YANG modules will adopt a SemVer-like versioning scheme.
    *   Tooling (`pyang`, `rfcstrip`, `libyang`) will be updated and integrated into the Datatracker's YANG linting process.
    *   Three related Internet-Drafts will be held at the Auth48 phase pending the completion and deployment of the necessary tooling updates.

## Next Steps

*   **Notewell**: Ongoing internal discussion within IESG and IAB to refine the Notewell's in-meeting presentation and content based on community feedback.
*   **Datatracker Tooling**: Fix identified bugs, conduct a community review of the fixes, and deploy to production. The IESG will update guidance and promote tool usage.
*   **RFC Production Center**: Continue with pilot programs, develop new editing software, and complete the RFC Editor website revamp. Further work on archiving GitHub interactions is planned.
*   **YANG Module Versioning**: Complete tooling updates and integration into Datatracker. Advise YANG doctors on the new rules. Advance the three associated drafts once tooling is ready.
*   **RFC 2418 Revision**: Community members are encouraged to review ongoing draft revisions on the `procon` mailing list or via GitHub and provide feedback.
