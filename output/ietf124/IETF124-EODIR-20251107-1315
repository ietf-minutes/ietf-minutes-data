# EODIR Session

## Summary

The EODIR (External Outreach and Communications) session opened with an administrative note clarifying its status as an official IETF activity, rather than a side meeting, and the name change from EMODIR. The session provided updates on the Sisters in Engineering (SISTERS) program, new participant initiatives, IETF outreach activities, the Working Group Chairs (WGC) Forum, and the Guides program. A significant portion of the discussion centered on challenges and potential improvements related to GitHub usage within the IETF, specifically concerning documentation, training, and the diverse workflows employed by different working groups.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **EODIR Administration:**
    *   EODIR (formerly EMODIR) is now an official IETF open meeting, not a side meeting, reflecting its status as an official IETF activity.
    *   Outreach beyond the IETF is within the purview of the IAB, with EODIR coordinating independent activities.
    *   The session emphasized that participants drive activities; "Who's going to do it? It might be you."

*   **SISTERS Update:**
    *   Feedback from the IETF 123 "bridging perspective event" (workshop for SISTERS members and IETF leadership) was mixed on content but positive overall for fostering interaction. It was deemed a successful experiment.
    *   At IETF 124, two low-key networking events (breakfast and lunch) were well-attended (approx. 30-40 people each).
    *   Discussion confirmed SISTERS' core mission to focus on retention and improving the IETF experience for attendees. The mailing list will be used to discuss clearer actions and measurement methods.

*   **New Participant Program Update:**
    *   43% of IETF 124 attendees were new participants (first-time or attended 1-4 meetings), indicating high engagement and return rates.
    *   A thorough review of the revised all-day new participant program will be conducted after a full year of operation. Initial assessment suggests it's "right on par."
    *   The Thursday social hour saw exceptional leadership attendance and strong networking among new participants and leadership. Attendance was 35 (compared to 52 in Madrid).
    *   Suggestion to gather new participants' areas of interest (e.g., SEC, ART, Routing) to facilitate more efficient connections, potentially via the guides program or quick connection sessions.
    *   The post-lunch "Advanced Topics" presentation on Sunday was revised to "Power of the Community," focusing on community creation and handling disputes/appeals. Early indications suggest better retention and engagement.
    *   Feedback on program length was mixed; some found it too long, suggesting breakpoints for choice. The program already advises it's a long agenda and can be completed over multiple meetings.
    *   Challenges in providing "easy to understand" session pitches without conflicting with participants' desire to read drafts.
    *   Rotating presenters for the new participant program is planned for future meetings (e.g., Vienna).

*   **Outreach Activities:**
    *   Recent outreach activities included: Ripe and CAPF events (European region), an IAB panel, Eric Vyncke's cooperation working group panel, ICANN (leadership focus, future community engagement), Lacknick, Trinidad ISOC regions, and events in India (school of governance, youth IGF).
    *   EODIR provides resources on its wiki, including a standard IETF overview presentation template customizable for different audiences (IG, general, students, researchers).
    *   Emphasis that outreach is for anyone in the community, not just leadership, with EODIR offering support.
    *   A comment highlighted that people struggle to find these resources; a broader email to the community about their availability was suggested. Resources were recently moved to the top of the outreach page for visibility.
    *   Discussion about specific outreach to students, particularly for Hackathons, noting existing presentations and the value of Hackathons as an entry point. IRTF also does some academic outreach.
    *   Visible IETF presence at other events (e.g., Ripe) sends a positive message, even if immediate effects aren't seen.

*   **Working Group Chairs Forum Update:**
    *   The WGC Forum had a full agenda with no specific actions or training mandated.
    *   Continuing conversations revolved around the "Note Well" and the distinction between required processes and available tools.
    *   A helpful email with pointers to resources was sent to the WGC list by the Secretariat (Greg and Cindy), which was well-received as a timely reminder. This is part of a plan to send such emails periodically and to new WGCs.

*   **Guides Program Update:**
    *   23 matches were made for IETF 124 (3 remote), which is slightly higher than average.
    *   Efforts are ongoing to make matches earlier, though participants often sign up late.
    *   Michelle and Jay plan to follow up with guides and new participants (via mini-surveys) to gather feedback and express thanks.
    *   Suggestions for guides included: meeting at the end of the week for wrap-up questions, and advising on preferred asynchronous communication methods (e.g., Slack, WhatsApp). WhatsApp was specifically noted for not being on the current list of suggested methods.
    *   The newcomer social hour typically focuses on leadership interaction, but potential for guide attendance was discussed.
    *   72 new participants attended Quick Connections, with 37 experienced IETFers.
    *   A separate Slack channel for new participants (e.g., "new participants 124") was proposed.
    *   An observation was made about a cohort of 16 participants from Brazil who received multi-year funding, highlighting the positive impact of such initiatives.

*   **Tutorials / GitHub Discussion:**
    *   A virtual interim meeting on September 17th discussed GitHub usage, identifying two primary user groups (experienced vs. IETF-specific users) and different roles (contributors, reviewers, chairs).
    *   Three potential near-term outcomes were identified for GitHub documentation:
        1.  "Organize your workspace" for WGCs (Rich had initial content, but progress is slow).
        2.  Better pointers to Martin Thompson's tooling/authoring resources and pull request review guides.
        3.  Greg and Deb are working on general GitHub documentation.
    *   A concern was raised that the problem isn't a lack of information, but difficulty in finding clear and concise documentation.
    *   The "Welcome to the Chair Role" initiative (the secretariat email) was recognized as helpful but doesn't fully address all GitHub needs.
    *   A participant is working on documentation for Martin Thompson's repo template and plans a pull request.
    *   A key unanswered question remains the relationship between mailing lists and GitHub for IETF consensus and discussion, given that many participants don't track GitHub issues regularly.
    *   Concern was expressed that the current approach to GitHub documentation and workflows might be too narrow, gathered from a small group. A broader conversation with working group chairs and authors is needed to identify actual requirements for tutorials/documentation.
    *   Reluctance to generate "tons more content" given existing volume; a "Cliff Notes" version and a communication strategy are needed.
    *   GitHub training needs to be practical and hands-on, acknowledging that expert trainers can sometimes move too fast. Different user types (authors, chairs, issue filers) have different needs.
    *   A significant concern was raised that GitHub (a commercial product) is becoming a "big barrier to entry" due to its complexity and inconsistent workflows across working groups. Authors are reportedly hesitant to use it.
    *   The idea of a "GitHub help desk," possibly at Hackathons, was suggested, similar to how Datatracker help is provided.
    *   Roman Gen identified a challenge with a help desk for GitHub given the lack of normative workflows; working groups often have bespoke processes for tagging, triaging, etc. This makes generic advice difficult and risks confusing participants about the "right" way to do things.
    *   A suggestion was made to add pointers on each working group's GitHub page to relevant wiki documentation.
    *   There is no general "participant" wiki equivalent to the "authors" or "chairs" wikis, which might need consideration.
    *   Emphasis on encouraging chairs to assist participants with their specific working group's GitHub process and to communicate that there is no single normative process for GitHub usage.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **SISTERS:** The core mission to concentrate on retention and improving the IETF experience was reaffirmed. The group will discuss clearer actions and measurement methods on the SISTERS mailing list.
*   **New Participant Program:** The "Advanced Topics" presentation on Sunday was changed to "Power of the Community." A thorough review of the revised all-day program will be conducted.
*   **Outreach:** The Secretariat (Greg and Cindy) will draft and send a broader distribution message about the availability of IETF outreach resources.
*   **Working Group Chairs Forum:** The plan to periodically send helpful resource pointers to the WGC list and new WGCs was affirmed.
*   **Guides Program:**
    *   Michelle will conduct mini-surveys with guides and new participants after the meeting to gather feedback.
    *   The list of suggested communication methods for guides will be updated to include WhatsApp.
    *   The Guides program will explore ways to thank guides more formally and regularly.
*   **GitHub Documentation/Tutorials:**
    *   Greg and Deb will continue their work on GitHub documentation.
    *   Rich will do a pull request on Martin Thompson's repo template to attach relevant documentation.
    *   The EODIR group will encourage volunteers to step forward to work on GitHub documentation and tutorials.
    *   A GitHub "help desk" at future Hackathons was supported by some participants.
