# GREEN

## Summary

This session of the GREEN Working Group covered administrative items, updates on the core foundational drafts, and fostered discussion on the path forward. Updates were provided on the Terminology, Use Cases, and Framework drafts, with an emphasis on aligning definitions and concepts across these documents and with future data models. A strong call for active participation in ongoing adoption polls was reiterated. The session culminated in a decision to launch an adoption poll for the Framework document, acknowledging the current impasse between framework and data model development and the need for concrete starting points.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Administrative Items and Working Group Status**
    *   The chairs (Rob and Diego) opened the session, highlighting the IETF Notewell, conduct policies, and the working group's professional expectations.
    *   The work is structured into short-term deliverables (Use Cases, Terminology, Framework) and long-term data modeling.
    *   Liaison statements from previous IETF meetings still require attention; volunteers are sought to help respond.
    *   **Adoption Calls**: Reminder that 3-week adoption polls are currently active for the Terminology and Use Cases drafts, extended due to the holiday period. Members were strongly urged to provide feedback (even simple "I support adoption" or "I do not support adoption" with reasons) on the mailing list to gauge interest and progress.
    *   Design-team-light meetings for modeling have started, with three held in October, and will continue post-meeting to progress common understanding.

*   **Terminology for Energy Efficiency Network Management (draft-ietf-green-energy-terminology)**
    *   Presented by **Jentchen**.
    *   The latest version is 05, with Sheddish added as a contributor.
    *   New definitions include "service level energy efficiency" and "energy-aware intent." Updated definitions clarify "device level" and "component level" energy efficiency.
    *   **Discussion**:
        *   **Rob**: Questioned if "energy-aware intent" and "service level energy efficiency" might be too early for inclusion, suggesting they should align with the framework and data model development. He proposed keeping the document as a living WG document, not rushing to RFC, to allow for evolution and alignment.
        *   **Mahesh**: Agreed with Rob regarding the potential for these terms to be premature, noting charter alignment and the need for data model discussions to clarify scope.
        *   **Speaker (unidentified)**: Suggested referencing RFC 936 for intent definitions and clarifying the scope of intent (network-wide vs. specific parts).
        *   **Benoit Awas**: Reiterated the importance of terms being used in other stable documents (framework, data models) before inclusion. Suggested a two-phase approach: include terms, check usage, then prune or refine. He proposed an appendix for potential future terms or storing them as GitHub issues.

*   **GREEN Use Cases (draft-ietf-green-use-cases)**
    *   Presented by **Emil** (noted a mistake in the slide title, it was for Use Cases, not Framework).
    *   The draft started in July 2024 and currently contains 15+1 use cases, including a recent addition by Xinu on "cross-level energy efficiency."
    *   A table mapping use cases to framework interfaces has been pushed to the framework draft, showing which interfaces each use case utilizes.
    *   **Next Steps for Draft**: Cross-validation to reduce overlaps (possibly using MPR 16 rules), continued documentation of the interface table, and checking relations with data modeling and terminology.
    *   **Action**: Address Mahesh's directions to finalize the Isaac use case and add Xinu to the author list.
    *   **Discussion**:
        *   **Mahesh**: Asked if there's an effort to identify which use cases the WG specifically wants to work on.
        *   **Rob**: Clarified that the plan is to adopt the document, then do a consensus call on the included use cases to establish the WG's focus. The document is intended to be a living WG record, not necessarily an RFC, to allow for new use cases as long as they align with the charter and bring new requirements.
        *   **Diego**: Clarified that the Isaac use case in this document will converge with the YANG model for Isaac (`draft-ietf-green-yang-isaac`).
        *   **Benoit Awas**: Emphasized that the main point is the ability to fulfill all use cases with the defined framework interfaces, supporting the idea that many use cases might use the same underlying data model.

*   **A Framework for Energy Management in Networks (draft-ietf-green-framework)**
    *   Presented by **Benoit Awas**.
    *   The document has seen three new revisions. A key conclusion is that most of the identified use cases can be solved with the building blocks in the framework.
    *   Key "green" specific concepts include energy objects, power interfaces, and metering relationships.
    *   A new G-interface (API service interface) has been added to support applications like PETR (Power Energy Traffic Ratio API).
    *   **Proposal for Data Modeling**: Benoit suggested using the existing Eman Working Group's MIP for power information (e.g., nameplate, unit multiplier, accuracy, current type) as a starting point for Yang modeling, rather than starting from scratch.
    *   **Discussion on Source ID and Yang Provenance**:
        *   Need for unique IDs (like EUID from RFC 4133 Entity MIB v4) for reporting.
        *   Discussion on using `draft-ietf-netmod-yang-provenance` for ensuring data origin (e.g., from routers vs. data sheets). Diego elaborated on the four options for adding signatures, with the simplest for new modules being adding a leaf element. The challenge of signing data sheet information was raised for further study.
    *   **Open Issues**: Discovering diverse capabilities (what "sleep" or "hibernate" means in different contexts), mapping intent to settings, transition handling, and ensuring safety.
    *   **Benoit's Concern**: Highlighted that the framework development and modeling efforts are in a "waiting mode," hindering progress. He emphasized that both are required and asked for adoption to break this impasse.
    *   **Rob's Response**: Acknowledged the concern and took some responsibility for slow organization. He emphasized the need for active participant engagement in the design-team-light meetings, as chairs are only facilitators. He suggested a GitHub-based approach for the model to encourage concrete contributions.
    *   **Diego's Response**: Agreed on the need for community feedback to delimit the core model and framework, especially regarding potential overlaps with other framework models (e.g., Jan's model). He urged comments on the adoption call.
    *   **Adoption Poll**: A show of hands indicated strong support for adopting the framework document.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Decision**: The GREEN Working Group chairs will launch an adoption poll for the `draft-ietf-green-framework` document on the mailing list. (Confirmed by strong in-room support).
*   **Action Item**: All working group members are strongly encouraged to review `draft-ietf-green-energy-terminology` and `draft-ietf-green-use-cases` and provide comments (even simple support/non-support) on the mailing list before the adoption polls close.
*   **Action Item**: Authors of `draft-ietf-green-energy-terminology` to continue aligning definitions with the framework and data model, and consider how to manage non-normative or future-use terms (e.g., an appendix or GitHub issues).
*   **Action Item**: Authors of `draft-ietf-green-use-cases` to finalize the Isaac use case and formally add Xinu to the author list.
*   **Action Item**: Chairs to facilitate and encourage broader participation in the ongoing "design-team-light" meetings focused on data modeling to unblock progress.
*   **Action Item**: Authors of `draft-ietf-green-framework` to continue exploring the integration of Eman MIB concepts for power information and address Yang provenance issues, particularly for data sheets.

## Next Steps

*   **Friday Session**: The working group will hold a second, two-hour session on Friday dedicated to detailed discussions on the data modeling work.
*   **Online Meetings**: Continued "design-team-light" online meetings will be organized to progress the modeling work towards concrete document contributions.
*   **Document Reviews**: Working group members are urged to actively participate in the adoption polls and provide constructive feedback on all working group drafts.
