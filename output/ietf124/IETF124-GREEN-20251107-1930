# GREEN

## Summary

The GREEN working group held its second session at IETF 124, focusing on the progress of various drafts and the critical next steps for establishing foundational YANG models for energy measurement and control. Presentations included an update on the Petra Green API, a proposed YANG model for Smart Power Distribution Units (PDUs), and a new proposal on application layer efficiency for web crawling. A significant portion of the session was dedicated to discussing the ongoing data modeling efforts, including a design team update and a proposal to leverage existing E-MAN MIB concepts for a device energy model. Through polls, the working group indicated a strong preference for focusing on concrete use cases and using E-MAN as a starting point for device modeling, while also proceeding with controller and aggregation models in parallel.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Chairs' Update:** The chairs noted that two adoption polls are currently open for existing drafts and encouraged reviews. The goal is to establish base data model drafts for the working group. Design team meetings have been set up but have struggled to gain significant traction.
*   **Petra Green API Update:**
    *   Louise presented an update on the Path Energy Traffic Radio API draft.
    *   **Motivation:** Provide visibility into energy consumption across network paths, retrieving metrics like `watts per gigabit`.
    *   **Changes:** Refined wording, expanded scope to endpoints beyond IP addresses (e.g., optical networks, network slices), added security considerations, and an annex on SLA negotiation for energy-efficient services.
    *   **Positioning:** Petra is envisioned as a potential API service interface within the Green Framework, operating at customer, service, and network levels, aligning with RFC 8309.
    *   **Feedback:** The group felt it was too early for adoption, as the draft depends on the stability of core base models. The unit `watts per gigabit` and its rationale (allocation proportional to throughput) are open for further discussion.
*   **Smart PDU YANG Model Proposal:**
    *   Louise also presented a draft for a YANG model for Smart PDUs.
    *   **Motivation:** Standardize a vendor-neutral approach for monitoring and controlling Smart PDUs, which currently rely on proprietary solutions.
    *   **Objectives:** Real-time energy telemetry, control at outlet/PDU level, support for automation (remote control, power optimization).
    *   **Discussion:** Carlos suggested reviewing Home Assistant's approach for generic wrappers. Nigel noted potential overlap with IETF IV (inventory model) for equipment. Concern was raised by Benoit about standardizing a specific "Smart PDU" module, suggesting it should be an extension or use generic building blocks from a broader GREEN framework.
    *   **Conclusion:** The work is considered in scope, and the base data models should eventually cover this use case.
*   **Application Layer Efficiency for Web Crawling (TCT):**
    *   Anton Yukovych presented a draft proposing a "Collaboration Tunnel" (TCT) to reduce energy waste from web crawling.
    *   **Problem:** Wasted bytes from repeatedly fetching unchanged content consume energy across network, server, and client layers.
    *   **Solution:** Using efficient JSON instead of HTML, server-generated SHA256 fingerprints as ETags, and JSON sitemaps for zero-fetch optimization (client-side hash comparison to skip unchanged URLs). Demonstrated significant bandwidth reduction (83%) and skip rates (70-90%).
    *   **Request for Guidance:** The presenter sought guidance from the GREEN WG on energy measurement methodology, whether to include kWh conversions, and how to quantify efficiency.
    *   **Chair's Feedback:** While metric terminology definitions might align with GREEN's scope, the protocol aspects and full-stack implications of this work seem to extend beyond the current GREEN charter. The chairs will consult with Area Directors and other relevant IETF working groups (e.g., HTTPBIS) to find the most appropriate home for this work.
*   **Data Model Design Team Update:**
    *   Jan provided an update on the design team's work, outlining a conceptual pipeline for energy data (Collect -> Aggregate -> Store -> Deliver -> Analyze -> Present -> Act).
    *   **Requirements:** Emphasized the need for a plugin architecture, traceability, rich metadata, and flexibility to align with evolving political and accounting standards.
    *   **Work Items:** Four main areas were identified: (1) Controller-side collection/aggregation, (2) Device-level interfaces for reporting, (3) Policy-based device power control, and (4) Network-level orchestrator control.
    *   **Discussion:** Med advocated for focusing on Work Items 3 and 4 (control) as core to GREEN, suggesting Work Items 1 and 2 are more generic. Jan countered that Work Item 1 (collection/aggregation) addresses a significant industry gap, while Work Item 2 (new device interfaces) would be a long-term endeavor given existing legacy.
*   **E-MAN Based Device Model Proposal:**
    *   Benoit presented a proposal for a "bottom-up" approach to data modeling, starting with core device power/energy reporting.
    *   **Rationale:** Operators need concrete ways to report power and energy, which is foundational for all use cases. He highlighted existing concepts from the E-MAN MIB (e.g., power tables, entity physical index, accuracy, caliber, energy tables).
    *   **Argument:** While E-MAN is MIB-based, its underlying schema and concepts address critical issues like identifying objects (device, interface), defining power values (SI units, direction), and handling measurement accuracy and calibration (actual, estimated, static). He argued that current implementations are a "mess" and a standardized YANG approach based on these proven concepts is needed.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Petra Green API:** The working group will continue to develop the Petra Green API as an individual draft. It is not ready for a working group adoption poll at this time.
*   **Application Layer Efficiency for Web Crawling (TCT):** The working group chairs will consult with relevant Area Directors and other IETF working groups to determine the most appropriate venue for further discussion and standardization of the TCT draft, particularly its protocol and full-stack aspects.
*   **Data Model Development:**
    *   The working group will focus its efforts on developing **concrete use cases** for data models, rather than purely abstract models. (Sense of the room: strong support)
    *   Work on **device models** will proceed. (Clear consensus)
    *   Work on **controller and aggregation models** will also proceed, in parallel with device models. (Sense of the room: split, but leaning towards parallel work)
    *   The existing **E-MAN MIB (or an RFC converted to E-MAN)** will be used as a **starting point** for the device model, providing a concrete basis for discussion and development. (Sense of the room: clear support)
*   **Adoption Polls:** The working group will continue to review and provide feedback on the two existing drafts currently open for adoption polls (open for another week). Following this, an adoption poll for the *green-framework* and *green-control-plane-model* documents will be initiated if authors agree.

## Next Steps

*   **Bi-Weekly Design Team Meetings:** The bi-weekly design team meetings will continue, providing a forum for detailed technical discussions on the data modeling efforts.
*   **Collaboration on Data Models:** Benoit, Jan, Marisol, and other interested individuals are encouraged to collaborate closely to drive the development of the foundational device, controller, and aggregation YANG models, utilizing E-MAN concepts as a starting point for the device model. The chairs will facilitate these efforts.
*   **Document Review:** Working group participants are encouraged to review the two drafts currently in adoption polls and provide feedback before the polls close.
