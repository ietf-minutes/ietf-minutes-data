# HACKATHON

## Summary

The Hackathon kickoff session welcomed participants, particularly newcomers to the IETF and hackathon, emphasizing the event's goal to advance IETF work through practical coding and collaboration. Key administrative details were covered, including project organization, schedule adjustments due to Daylight Saving Time, presentation guidelines, and available technical resources for project development and networking. Participants were encouraged to engage, utilize provided resources, and prepare for result presentations and the Hack Demo Happy Hour.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Hackathon Goals:**
    *   Advance IETF work by focusing on code and collaboration.
    *   Attract new software developers to standards work.
    *   Emphasize "rough consensus and running code."
*   **IETF Note Well and Licensing:**
    *   Participants reminded to review the IETF Note Well.
    *   Code contributions to open-source projects are governed by those projects' licenses and rules, distinct from IETF contributions.
*   **Project Organization and Team Formation:**
    *   Approximately 40 projects listed on the wiki, with more expected.
    *   Physical board near the entrance for team locations.
    *   "Lost and found" resource for individuals seeking projects or projects seeking specific skills.
*   **Schedule Overview:**
    *   Kickoff followed by a "team schedule" page for remote participant coordination (e.g., Zoom/WebEx/Gather sessions).
    *   Lunch at 1:00 PM (later than usual, aligning with the week's schedule).
    *   Dinner provided on Saturday evening.
    *   Hackathon concludes Saturday evening at 9:00 PM.
    *   **Daylight Saving Time (DST) Change:** DST ends Saturday night/Sunday morning. Clocks shift back one hour, effectively delaying Sunday's schedule by an hour (e.g., doors may be closed if arriving at the previous "scheduled" time).
    *   Sunday Schedule: Lunch, followed by results presentations.
*   **Results Presentations (Sunday):**
    *   Recommended to stop coding around 1:30 PM to prepare.
    *   Optional, but highly encouraged; presentations should be 2-3 minutes.
    *   Focus on objectives, outcomes, lessons learned, and planned contributions to working groups.
    *   Presentations uploaded via the DataTracker to the specific "results presentation" session.
    *   **Important:** Upload presentations *before* the session starts; use the exact same filename for revisions to avoid duplicates.
    *   Presentations will be run in upload order via MeetEcho.
    *   Hackathon ends Sunday at 4:00 PM.
*   **Collaboration Tools and Network:**
    *   **Gather:** Virtual collaboration space with hackathon-specific rooms and tables available. Attendees should report any user space limitations.
    *   **Hackathon Network:** Special network setup available for projects with specific network characteristics. Remote access to the IETF network is possible.
    *   **Personal APs:** Guidelines provided to prevent interference with IETF Wi-Fi; contact organizers for assistance.
*   **IETF GitHub Organization:**
    *   Available for hosting project code, with a dedicated repo for IETF 124.
    *   Templates for project presentations are available for download from this GitHub repo.
*   **Linking Implementations to Drafts:**
    *   Ability to add links to project code (e.g., GitHub repo) as an "additional resource" on individual drafts in the DataTracker.
    *   For Working Group drafts, chairs have permissions to add these links.
*   **Post-Hackathon Engagement:**
    *   **Hack Demo Happy Hour:** Monday, 7:00 PM - 8:00 PM, for extended demos and deeper discussions. Sign-up requested by 1:00 PM Monday for logistical planning.
    *   **Code Lounge:** Regular shared space for continued work post-hackathon.
*   **Sponsorship:** Acknowledgment and thanks to Ericsson (Gold Sponsor), CNNIC, and ICANN (Bronze Sponsors).

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Decision:** Daylight Saving Time ends tonight (Saturday into Sunday), shifting all Sunday activities one hour later than their nominal schedule times (e.g., a 9 AM start will feel like 10 AM to attendees who don't adjust).
*   **Action Item (Attendees):** Newcomers are encouraged to seek assistance finding teams or projects.
*   **Action Item (Attendees):** Review the IETF Note Well and understand the licensing implications for code contributed to open-source projects.
*   **Action Item (Attendees):** Utilize the wiki, physical project board, and "lost and found" for project and team coordination.
*   **Action Item (Remote Teams):** Use the "team schedule" page to coordinate remote meeting times and platforms (e.g., Zoom, WebEx, Gather).
*   **Action Item (Attendees):** For results presentations, upload slides to the DataTracker's designated "results presentation" session *before* the session starts. Use the exact same filename for any revisions.
*   **Action Item (Attendees):** Report any issues with Gather user space to the organizers.
*   **Action Item (Teams):** Adhere to guidelines if setting up personal APs to avoid IETF Wi-Fi interference.
*   **Action Item (Teams):** Consider adding implementation links to individual drafts in the DataTracker (contact WG chairs for WG drafts).
*   **Action Item (Attendees):** Sign up for the Hack Demo Happy Hour by 1:00 PM on Monday if planning to demo.

## Next Steps

*   Continued hackathon development work throughout Saturday.
*   Preparation and presentation of hackathon results on Sunday afternoon.
*   Engagement with the broader IETF community at the Hack Demo Happy Hour on Monday evening.
*   Ongoing code development in the Code Lounge.
