# NEWPARTICIPANT

## Summary

This session provided new IETF participants with an in-depth understanding of Internet Drafts and RFCs, including their structure, publication process, and associated tools. It also delved into the "Power of the Community," explaining the IETF's self-organizing nature, its governance, leadership selection via NOMCOM, code of conduct, and appeal processes. The session concluded with a look ahead at the week's activities and resources available to new participants.

## Key Discussion Points

### Internet Drafts and RFCs (Session 5, presented by Alice and Rich)

*   **RFCs Overview:**
    *   RFCs (Request For Comments) are the high-quality, relevant technical documents forming the core output of the IETF.
    *   They are freely available, stable, and support interoperability, spanning the internet's birth (e.g., TCP/IP) to modern standards (e.g., TLS 1.3, Quick).
    *   Documents are immutable once published; corrections are submitted as Errata (RADA).
    *   The RFC series is approaching 10,000 documents, with RFC 8700 (50 years of RFCs) highlighted for historical context.
*   **Publication Formats:**
    *   **Plaintext:** Original format, ASCII diagrams only, fixed line width, no hyperlinks, no dynamic metadata updates.
    *   **HTMLized:** Available for RFCs under 5xxx, includes a gray header for post-publication metadata (updates, obsoletes, errata), links within and between documents.
    *   **HTML:** For more recent RFCs, adaptive layout, supports SVG graphics, includes dynamic gray header for metadata (e.g., obsoleted by 9429).
    *   **PDF:** Paginated, similar look to HTML, includes links, but lacks dynamic metadata updates like the HTML versions.
    *   **RFC XML:** The source format for generating other publication formats, contains metadata and content.
*   **RFC Statuses:**
    *   **Informational:** Use cases, applicability statements, framework documents (e.g., path computation elements use cases).
    *   **Experimental:** Time-limited experiments, new extensions (e.g., IMAP message limit extension).
    *   **Proposed Standard:** First official stage of a standard, where many documents remain (~60% of recent RFCs) (e.g., Quick, TLS 1.3).
    *   **Draft Standard:** Deprecated maturity level, no longer used.
    *   **Internet Standard:** Full standard, widely deployed and interoperable (e.g., Multicast Listener Discovery for IPv6 - STD 101).
    *   **Best Current Practice (BCP):** Dual role for process (IETF standards process) or technology best practices (e.g., OAUTH 2.0 security).
    *   **Historic:** Superseded specifications not to be used (e.g., NTP V2/V3). Note: Obsoleted RFCs are not always marked Historic.
    *   **Unknown:** RFCs published before statuses existed (e.g., RFC 1 from 1969).
*   **Sub-series:**
    *   **STD (Internet Standards):** Numbering for Internet Standards (e.g., STD 5: IP, STD 7: TCP). Can change over time as RFCs are updated/obsoleted.
    *   **BCP (Best Current Practices):** Numbering for BCPs (e.g., BCP 9: IETF standards process, BCP 226: meeting venue selection process, composed of four RFCs).
*   **Streams:** Indicates the origin of the document.
    *   **IETF Stream:** Largest, publishes any status, only stream for STD and BCP sub-series (~90% of recent RFCs).
    *   **IAB (Internet Architecture Board):** Informational, experimental, historic RFCs related to architecture.
    *   **IRTF (Internet Research Task Force):** Informational, experimental, historic documents from research groups.
    *   **Editorial:** Policies of the RFC series.
    *   **Independent Submission:** RFCs outside official IETF/IAB/IRTF processes but relevant, with a conflict review.
    *   **Legacy:** RFCs published before the concept of streams existed (~2000 documents).
*   **Internet Draft Structure and Content:**
    *   **Common Elements (Drafts & RFCs):** Title, author/editors, publication date, status, updates/obsoletes (e.g., TLS 1.3 obsoletes TLS 1.2).
    *   **Draft-specific Elements:** Working group, stream (implied for adopted drafts), expiration date (archived after 6 months).
    *   **Auto-generated Sections (for RFCs):** Status of the Memo (boilerplate), Copyright and IPR, Table of Contents, Abstract (short summary), Introduction (motivation), Security Considerations (must-have), IANA Considerations (protocol registries), References (normative and informative).
*   **Writing Internet Drafts:**
    *   Anyone can write and submit a draft; no permission or pre-checking required. Can be used for technical discussion.
    *   Once submitted, a draft cannot be removed (with rare historical exceptions).
    *   Submission grants rights to the IETF Trust for distribution.
    *   **Naming Convention:** `draft-username-short-blurb-NN` (individual), `draft-ietf-wg-name-short-blurb-NN` (working group adopted).
    *   **Recommended Tooling:** **Cramdown-RFC Markdown** is strongly recommended for writing. Avoid direct RFC XML, Enroff, or Microsoft Word.
        *   Cramdown-RFC adds metadata (references, working group, GitHub repo) and stylistic conventions (e.g., `{{RFC 2616}}` for automatic linking).
    *   **Language Guidelines:** BCP 14 defines keywords like MUST/MAY/SHALL (all caps, bold in output). Inclusive language is encouraged (e.g., primary/secondary instead of master/slave).
    *   **Author Tools (authors.IETF.org):** Provides guidance on toolchains, style guides, and special content (diagrams, formal languages like ABNF, Yang).
    *   **author-tools.IETF.org:** A site to upload plain text/XML, render it in various formats (PDF, HTML, XML), run diffs, and perform IDNITs (Internet Draft NITs) to check for style violations, missing sections (abstract, copyright), or content errors.
    *   **Submission to Datatracker (datatracker.ietf.org):** Click "Submit a Draft," browse and upload. Tool validates, checks with authors, and sends confirmation email.
    *   **Cut-off Dates:** No new drafts can be submitted two weeks before a plenary meeting; submission reopens after the meeting.
*   **RFC Publication Process (RFC Production Center - RPC):**
    *   Once an Internet Draft is approved for publication, the RPC takes control of the source file, assigns an RFC number, and performs professional copy editing.
    *   **AUTH48 (Authors 48 Hours):** Authors review the edited document before final publication, ensuring technical accuracy and clear meaning.
    *   RPC ensures IANA actions are clearly documented.
    *   Each author listed in the header must approve the AUTH48 draft.
    *   RPC creates various final formats and announces publication on IETF announce and RFC dist mailing lists.
*   **Resources:** authors.IETF.org, I-D-Template (GitHub tooling by Martin Thompson).

### The Power of the Community (Session 6, presented by Harold Alvestrand)

*   **IETF Mission:** "Make the Internet Work Better."
*   **Nature of IETF:**
    *   Volunteer-driven, contributing to documents to achieve the mission.
    *   Self-organizing: The community is the final arbiter of its activities.
    *   No defined membership: Participation makes one a member of the community.
*   **Governance Structure:** IESG (Internet Engineering Steering Group), IAB (Internet Architecture Board), IETF LLC (legal entity).
*   **Nominating Committee (NOMCOM):**
    *   Selects IETF leadership.
    *   **Process:** Volunteers (must show participation in 3 out of the last 5 IETF meetings) are selected randomly. No two members from the same company.
    *   Consists of 10 randomly selected volunteers and 5 non-voting liaisons (from IAB, IESG, ISOC, IETF LLC, IETF Trust) for historical context and questions.
    *   A new NOMCOM is selected annually, with a chair (usually an experienced community member) appointed by the ISOC President.
    *   NOMCOM calls for nominations, interviews candidates, and selects based on qualifications.
    *   Selected "slates" are sent to confirming bodies (e.g., IAB for IESG) who can reject but rarely do.
    *   Selections are announced, and new leaders are seated at the March IETF meeting.
*   **Code of Conduct and Disruptive Behavior:**
    *   **Core Principles:** Extend respect and courtesy, assume good intent, focus on technical arguments, avoid personal attacks or non-technical comments.
    *   **Managing Disruptive Behavior:** Forum chairs can intervene (e.g., "step down," suspend mailing list privileges).
    *   **Ombuds Team:**
        *   Handles interpersonal issues (harassment, intimidation, belittling behavior).
        *   Operates with complete confidentiality: Investigates, recommends actions, and ensures follow-through without disclosing details.
        *   Members are publicly identified and available for contact.
*   **Consensus and Appeals:**
    *   IETF strives for "rough consensus" (or just "consensus"), often indicated by humming in Meetecho.
    *   If a participant believes a decision is wrong (technical or process error), they can appeal.
    *   **Appeal Process (multi-step):**
        1.  **Working Group Chair:** First decision-maker. Can reopen discussion or uphold the decision.
        2.  **Responsible AD (Area Director):** Informal discussion.
        3.  **IESG (Internet Engineering Steering Group):** Formal appeal (public). The entire IESG deliberates and delivers a public decision (denied or sent back to WG).
        4.  **IAB (Internet Architecture Board):** Appeal of an IESG decision (public).
        5.  **Internet Society Board of Trustees:** Third level of appeal, only on process, not technical content (very rare).
    *   Appeals are time-consuming and taken very seriously by leadership.

### Wrap-up and Next Steps (presented by Michelle and Jay)

*   **New Participant Program Goals:** Provide general IETF information, organizational overview, useful meeting info, leadership/resources, hackathon intro, basic standards process, Internet Draft writing guide, and effectiveness tips.
*   **Feedback:** A survey will be sent out for feedback on the program.

## Decisions and Action Items
