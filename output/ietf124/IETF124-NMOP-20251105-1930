# NMOP

## Summary

The NMOP session featured updates and discussions across three main topics: China Telecom's experience with network incidents and AI-based operations, the results of the CMAP hackathon focusing on SRv6 path computation, and an update on the CMAP YANG modeling efforts and the Knowledge Graph Design Team. Key discussions included the application of AI-Ops to diagnose complex network faults, identified gaps in existing CMAP modeling for SRv6, and a critical debate on the use and standardization of YANG profiles (T-profiles) in the IETF context. The Knowledge Graph Design Team presented a Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrating the integration of IETF data with external ontologies to create queryable network knowledge.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **China Telecom Incident and AI-based Network Operation**
    *   **Incident Description:** A 5G NG interface alarm occurred due to SRv6 packet source IP addresses being reported as unknown (all zeros) by a CE router during a capacity event. This led to SCTP connection handshake failures between base stations and the AMF.
    *   **Root Causes:**
        *   A software bug in a CE router, triggered by misconfiguration of an SRv6 address, caused the deletion of the IPv6 source address in the underlying table.
        *   A spine router failed to report packet discard information to the network management system, thus obscuring the problem.
    *   **IETF Relevance:** Noted that IPF forwarding status (IPFix) and ongoing drafts in OPSAWG on packet discard reporting could be helpful for future incident resolution.
    *   **AI-Ops Architecture:** China Telecom presented a four-layered AI-Ops architecture:
        *   **Corpus:** Network-related text (chain of thoughts), images, vocabularies used for training domain-specific models.
        *   **Model Metrics:** Combination of multi-type models (language, time-series, multi-modal, specific optimization models).
        *   **Toolchain:** Platform for streamlined model development and deployment, including training, inference, agent development, and operation tools.
        *   **Application:** Examples include "present assistant" and AI agents (over 330 developed, 23 types of "digital employees").
    *   **Comments on MOPP Architecture:** Suggested extending the MOPP architecture to include building blocks for AI agents, as well as mechanisms for exposure, identification, and authorization of these agents.
    *   **Q&A:** A participant inquired about the alignment of China Telecom's internal knowledge graph with existing IETF knowledge graph documents, noting it's currently a proprietary solution. Another question clarified the troubleshooting process, emphasizing that packet captures were used after initial ping tests showed normal network connectivity.

*   **CMAP Hackathon Results (SRv6 C-MAP)**
    *   **Focus:** The hackathon focused on computing the physical path of a packet based on the SRv6 C-MAP model and identifying necessary extensions to RFC 8345.
    *   **Achievements:** Implemented micro-CIDs in labs, enabled link-enabled same mechanism, developed algorithms for physical path computation, and began modeling the path using RFC 8345.
    *   **Conclusions/Gaps:** Identified missing elements in the CMAP model:
        *   Supporting relationships from links to supporting links to understand path computation.
        *   Properties for preference and weight for segment lists and segments.
    *   **Next Hackathon Focus:** Modeling the identified gaps, keeping synchronization with the CMAP YANG draft and ISIS topology, and extending path computation algorithms.

*   **CMAP YANG and Side Meeting**
    *   **Goal:** To initiate discussion on CMAP modeling based on requirements, present proposed approaches for extending RFC 8345, and summarize findings.
    *   **Draft Scope:** Focus is on proposing YANG module extensions or augmentations to RFC 8345 to address identified gaps, rather than creating an entirely new module.
    *   **Identified Gaps (from operators' requirements):** Grouped into topological (bi-directional links, multi-point, sub-networks), extendability, and lifecycle management, with some requiring further study.
    *   **Discussion on Bi-directional Links:** RFC 8345 models bi-directional links as two unidirectional links. A proposal was made for an explicit bi-directional link option using an identity for TP direction and a list of TPs within the model. Discussion included the advantages of a single entity for lifecycle management versus the current two-unidirectional approach.
    *   **Discussion on Multi-point:** RFC 8345 proposes modeling multi-point connections via a pseudo-node with links to all endpoints. A proposal for direct multi-point representation was discussed, aiming for simpler lifecycle management, especially for VPNs with many endpoints.
    *   **Cross-cutting Issue: YANG Profiles (T-profiles):** A significant part of the discussion revolved around the use of "profiles" (or T-profiles) to manage the complexity and size of YANG models, particularly RFC 8795.
        *   Concerns were raised about the lack of programmatic definition, tooling support, versioning, and library capabilities for profiles within the IETF framework.
        *   The NetMod chair indicated that while profiles might be useful internally for operators, they are not yet a broadly accepted or programmatically defined generic approach within IETF, leading to reluctance to mandate their use for current modeling efforts.
        *   It was acknowledged that many implementations use a subset of a model, but the formal definition and tooling implications of "profiling" remain a challenge.

*   **Knowledge Graph Design Team Update**
    *   **Team Composition:** Diverse group from Telefonica, Orange, Swisscom, Huawei, academia, Broadband Australia, Cisco.
    *   **PoC Demonstration:** The team developed a Proof of Concept (PoC) by integrating an existing external ontology (NOIA from Orange) with an RDFS representation of CMAP data (from a previous hackathon).
        *   This demonstrated how IT models and IETF network data could be combined into a queryable graph format.
        *   The PoC successfully linked IETF network data with external information like trouble tickets, network parts, and organizational entities, showcasing the potential for augmenting IETF data with new insights.
    *   **Goal:** To take existing IETF models and knowledge, convert them into a graph format, enable querying, discover new connections, and provide a way to document these relationships for the community, rather than creating new models.
    *   **IETF Fit (BoF-like Questions):**
        *   **Problem Solved:** Yes, addressing fragmentation in extensive YANG models and connecting data with defined relationships. IETF is the right group due to its network expertise.
        *   **Critical Mass:** Yes, a diverse design team with growing interest from operators like China Unicom and China Mobile.
        *   **Scope:** Still "a little bit vague". The current plan is to start with a sample set of use cases, develop requirements, and then propose deliverables before the Shenzhen IETF meeting.
    *   **Discussion on Standardization:** Questions arose regarding how to standardize evolving ontologies (e.g., as RFCs, or through other processes like ONIONS, which is still in charter development). It was recognized that while IETF has networking expertise, its processes might be too rigid for constantly evolving knowledge. The fragmentation of models is definitively an IETF problem.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **China Telecom:** Provide specific suggestions for MOPP architecture extensions (e.g., regarding AI agent exposure, identification, authorization) to the NMOP mailing list.
*   **CMAP YANG Modeling:** The draft will be updated to reflect feedback from the bi-directional link discussion.
*   **YANG Profiles:** Italo Buzzi will send an email to the NetMod mailing list to initiate a broader discussion on the generic problem of YANG profiles (e.g., programmatic definition, tooling, versioning).
*   **CMAP YANG Modeling (Immediate):** For the ongoing CMAP modeling effort, the working group will continue to focus on using and augmenting RFC 8345, rather than waiting for a generic IETF consensus or programmatic definition of "profiles."
*   **Knowledge Graph Design Team:** The team is tasked with defining a sample set of use cases, developing requirements, and proposing specific deliverables before IETF 120 (Shenzhen).

## Next Steps

*   **CMAP Hackathon:** The next hackathon will focus on modeling the identified gaps related to supporting relationships and properties for segment lists/segments.
*   **CMAP YANG Modeling:** Continue the analysis and proposal of solutions for other identified requirements, including multi-point connections, sub-networks, extendability, and lifecycle management. An interim meeting may be considered after IETF 124.
*   **Knowledge Graph Design Team:** Proceed with defining use cases, requirements, and deliverables. Continue exploring appropriate IETF processes or mechanisms for standardizing or managing evolving ontologies and knowledge graphs, potentially in coordination with future efforts like ONIONS.
