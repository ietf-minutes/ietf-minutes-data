# RATS Session Meeting Minutes

## Summary

The RATS working group session covered updates on several drafts, administrative items, and discussions on the path forward for new and existing work. Key technical updates included the integration of CWT claims into CoRIM for better interoperability and revised definitions in the PKCS Evidence for HSM attestation draft. The group also discussed a taxonomy for composite attesters and a hackathon implementation of TIP with Bayesian. A significant portion of the session focused on administrative guidance from the chairs and AD, emphasizing the need for more working group reviews to clear the existing document backlog before adopting new work. A proposal for a security considerations guideline document sparked a lengthy discussion regarding its scope and format, with a consensus leaning towards a template or wiki-based guidance rather than a full threat model published as an RFC.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Administrative & Document Progress:**
    *   Chairs requested more working group reviews and volunteers for document shepherding to clear the current backlog of drafts. This is crucial for progressing existing documents and opening capacity for new work.
    *   Michael Richardson volunteered to shepherd the "Device Subscription ID" draft.
*   **Concise Reference Integrity Manifest (CoRIM):**
    *   The draft has closed 13 issues and 20 pull requests since the last IETF, with its feature set now frozen.
    *   **Technical Update:** CWT claims were added to the COSE header for enhanced interoperability with existing IETF standards (specifically RFC 9597), allowing validity to be expressed using standard CWT claims. The current CDDL supports both legacy and CWT claims, with CWT being the preferred method.
    *   **Technical Update:** A diagram illustrating the CoRIM Verifier processing flow was added to the document.
    *   The AD confirmed that early security and ART directorate reviews for CoRIM can be requested immediately.
    *   Discussion on the IESG review process clarified that working group reviews should precede IESG reviews, as early directorate reviews do not guarantee AD attention or prevent later "discuss" comments.
    *   Concerns were raised about the urgency of CoRIM reaching a stable stage due to active implementations and industry dependencies.
*   **PKCS Evidence for Remote Attestation of Hardware Security Modules (HSM):**
    *   The "root of trust" concept was removed, and attribute definitions were aligned with EAT and PKCS11 specifications.
    *   **Technical Contribution:** The "Role of Presenter" was introduced to define an entity that initiates attestation for HSMs (which cannot attest themselves) and selects what evidence is disclosed, without holding cryptographic state.
    *   **Technical Contribution:** The concept of "entities" (e.g., keys, platforms) and "attributes" (claims) was introduced to handle the large addressable state of an HSM, allowing selective disclosure of evidence.
    *   Feedback was requested on changing "entity" to "subject" and whether the "Role of Presenter" should be a more general RATS specification.
    *   Discussion clarified that HSMs only attest to what they directly observe and cannot attest to external correctness. There was a debate about whether a "Presenter" can truly create evidence given RFC 9334's definition of an "Attester."
*   **Remote Attestation with Multiple Verifiers:**
    *   The draft clarified its scope, including motivation, use cases, architecture, security, and privacy, while temporarily excluding verifier discovery/selection and inter-verifier message formats.
    *   **Technical Update:** New use cases for multi-component attestation (e.g., CPU+GPU from different vendors) and confidential computing workload verification were added.
    *   **Security & Privacy:** The draft outlines threat models for hierarchical, cascade, and hybrid multi-verifier patterns, emphasizing mutual attestation and encryption to mitigate sensitive information leakage. Evidence between the attester and relying party is out of scope.
    *   Discussion highlighted industry concerns regarding vendor unwillingness to release policies, which drives the need for multiple verifiers.
*   **Integration of Remote Attestation with Key Negotiation and Distribution:**
    *   Introduced a new use case for large language model deployment in private networks.
    *   **Technical Update:** Key binding mechanisms were added to prevent "derivation attacks" (key delivery to unintended users) by binding attestation messages with an attested ID (public key/certificate).
    *   The goal is a lightweight key management solution integrated with remote attestation, usable with attested TLS and other protocols.
    *   Two main modes (passport and background check) and three use cases (public cloud, secure channels for sensitive data, private network LLM deployment) were presented.
*   **Taxonomy for Composite Attesters:**
    *   Seven classes of composite attesters were presented with diagrams to provide a common language for discussion within the working group.
    *   Classes range from simple, non-composite attesters to complex scenarios involving local verifiers, external component verifiers (background check and passport models), chained attestation, and recursive composition.
    *   Discussion focused on potential redundancies between classes (e.g., Class 1 vs. 3B, Class 2 vs. 3P) and the completeness of the taxonomy, acknowledging that very complex scenarios (like mobile phones) might not fully fit.
    *   A suggestion was made to redefine the taxonomy based on fundamental components (e.g., what each attestation environment claims) rather than distinct patterns, which could better categorize the infinite combinations.
*   **Hackathon: Secure Software Provisioning with TIP and Variation:**
    *   A hackathon project demonstrated the viability of the TIP protocol for remote attestation using Bayesian as a verifier, to securely provision WASM applications.
    *   **Technical Feedback:** Issues were identified with existing Bayesian plugins and the EAT attestation result module regarding support for CBOR encoding and specific claims required by the TIP EAT profile. A generic EAT plugin for TIP was implemented.
*   **Guidelines for Security Considerations in RATS:**
    *   A new draft was proposed to provide a baseline for threat models and security/privacy considerations for RATS documents, aiming for consistency and ease of reference.
    *   The proposal included an outline covering system models, actors, legal requirements, threat models (adversary powers, security goals), typical attacks, and potential mitigations.
    *   **Discussion:** The AD and other participants expressed strong reservations about publishing a full "threat model" as an RFC, citing the effort involved, the rapid evolution of threats, and the potential for it to become a "never-ending document."
    *   There was a general consensus that a *template* or *guidance* for security/privacy *considerations* (perhaps as a non-RFC document or wiki entry) would be highly valuable for authors to ensure consistency and quality across drafts, but it should focus on guiding questions and structure rather than an exhaustive threat model.
    *   It was suggested that if specific security issues are identified in existing RFCs (e.g., misinterpretation of CTI claims), these should be addressed via update documents.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Chairs:** Will request early security and ART directorate reviews for the CoRIM draft.
*   **Working Group Participants:**
    *   **ACTION:** Review existing documents to help clear the backlog. The chairs will provide a list of urgent documents.
    *   **ACTION:** Volunteers are encouraged to step forward for document shepherding.
    *   **ACTION (CoRIM Authors):** Address any outstanding review comments, especially the new issues filed by Usama and the shepherd review comments.
    *   **ACTION (PKCS Evidence for HSM Authors):** Continue bi-weekly meetings. Seek feedback on nomenclature ("entity" to "subject") and the placement of the "Role of Presenter" definition.
    *   **ACTION (Multiple Verifiers Authors):** Continue work on security and privacy considerations, with a goal of having a robust section before a call for adoption.
    *   **ACTION (Key Negotiation & Distribution Authors):** Engage with Thomas on the RatsDI API for attestation request messages. Further improve security and privacy considerations.
    *   **ACTION (Hackathon Presenters):** Kenta Takayama confirmed he will contribute pull requests based on the identified issues with Bayesian and EAT profile support for TIP.
    *   **ACTION (Usama - Security Guidelines):** Collaborate offline with chairs and AD to refine the scope and format of the security considerations guidance, likely moving towards a template or wiki-based approach rather than an RFC for a full threat model.
*   **Michael Richardson:** Will update the "Conceptual Message Wrapper" draft (v19/20) and send it to the AD. He will also ping Peter Lee for any outstanding review comments.

## Next Steps

*   The working group will prioritize reviewing and progressing existing documents to clear the backlog.
*   The chairs will revisit adoption calls for the "Remote Attestation with Multiple Verifiers" and "Integration of Remote Attestation with Key Negotiation and Distribution" drafts once the backlog is sufficiently cleared and security/privacy considerations are robust.
*   Discussions on the "Taxonomy for Composite Attesters" will continue, potentially exploring a more granular, component-based approach to defining classes.
*   The conceptual "Guidelines for Security Considerations in RATS" work will proceed with an adjusted scope, focusing on creating a reusable template or wiki-based guidance for security and privacy considerations for future drafts.
*   The "Reference Interaction Model" draft needs to address outstanding shepherd review comments.
*   The "Conceptual Message Wrapper" draft is expected to be published as a new version and moved to telechat after final AD review.
